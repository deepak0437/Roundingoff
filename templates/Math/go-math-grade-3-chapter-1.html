<p>Question 4<br />
Josh estimates the height of his desk. Which is the best estimate?</p>
<p>(a) 1 foot<br />
(b) 2 feet<br />
(c) 5 feet<br />
(d) 9 feet</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>So, from the given choices, 2 feet or approximately 24 inches would be the most viable answer because most standard desks have a height around 28 inches to 30 inches. 1 foot is too low, while 5 feet and 9 feet are too high. Therefore, 3 to 4 feet would be the most perfect answer but since we have a limited number of options, the nearest reasonable estimate value would be 2 feet. The original numbers from a problem does not exceed in a reasonable estimate.</p>
<p>Option (b) is correct.</p>

The table shows the number of sweaters sold online in three months. How many sweaters were sold in January and February?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">       </span> sweaters</p>
<p>Answer: 700 sweaters</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>

The number of sweets sold in the month of February = 298<br />
First, make the friendly numbers to make the addition easy.|<br />
Subtract 2 from 402 = 402 &#8211; 2 = 400<br />
Next add 2 to 298 = 298 + 2 = 300<br />
Now add both<br />
400 + 300 = 700<br />
Therefore 700 sweaters were sold in January and February.</p>

<p>The number of sweets sold in the month of January = 402<br />
The number of sweets sold in the month of March = 171<br />
To find how many more sweaters were sold in January than March, we have subtracted the number of sweaters sold in the march from January<br />
402 &#8211; 171 = 231<br />
231 more sweaters were sold in January than March.</p>
<p>Question 12</p>
<p>How many more sweaters were sold in February and March than in January?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">       </span> sweaters</p>
<p>Answer: 67 sweaters</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>The number of sweets sold in the month of January = 402<br />
The number of sweets sold in the month of February = 298<br />
The number of sweets sold in the month of March = 171<br />
Total number of sweaters sold in February and March = 298 + 171 = 469<br />
Now subtract 402 from 469<br />
469 &#8211; 402 = 67 sweaters<br />
67 more sweaters were sold in February and March than in January.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">       </span> emails</p>
<p>Answer: 31 emails</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Alexandra has 78 emails in her inbox.<br />
She deletes 47 emails.<br />
Let x be the number of emails left in her inbox<br />
x + 47 = 78<br />
x = 78 &#8211; 47<br />
x = 31<br />
Therefore, 31 emails are left in her inbox.</p>

1 will be borrowed from tens place. So 0 becomes 10.<br />
10 &#8211; 8 = 2<br />
4 &#8211; 4 = 0<br />
300 &#8211; 100 = 200<br />
200 + 2 = 202<br />
Now add 2 to 202 you get 204.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">       </span> books</p>
<p>Answer: 327 books</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Sunnyday Elementary School is having its annual Read-a-thon.<br />
The third graders have read 573 books so far. Their goal is to read more than 900 books.<br />
Let the 3rd graders have to read the total number of books = x<br />
x + 573 = 900<br />
x = 900 &#8211; 573<br />
x = 327<br />
Thus the least number of books they need to read to reach their goal is 327 books.</p>
<p>Question 18<br />
There are 318 fiction books in the class library. The number of nonfiction books is 47 less than the number of fiction books.</p>
<p>Part A</p>
<p>About how many nonfiction books are there in the class library? Explain.</p>
<p>About <span style="text-decoration: underline;">       </span> nonfiction books</p>
<p>Answer: About 270 nonfiction books</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Given that,<br />
There are 318 fiction books in the class library.<br />
The number of nonfiction books is 47 less than the number of fiction books.<br />
Number of non fictions books = x<br />
x + 47 = 318<br />
x = 318 &#8211; 47<br />
x = 271<br />
The number closer to 271 is 270.<br />
So, there are about 270 nonfiction books.</p>
<p>Question 18<br />
Part B</p>
<p>How many fiction and nonfiction books are there in the class library altogether? Show your work.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">       </span> total books</p>
<p>Answer: 589</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Number of fiction books = 318<br />
Number of nonfiction books = 271<br />
To find the total number of books we need to add both fiction and nonfiction books<br />
= 318 + 271 = 589<br />
There are 589 books in the class library.</p>
