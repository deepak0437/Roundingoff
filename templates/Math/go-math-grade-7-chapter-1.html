The sum of two integers with different signs is 8. Give two possible integers that fit this description.<br />
Type below:<br />
____________</p>
<p>Answer: 10 and -2</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
10 and 2<br />
10 &#8211; 2 = 8<br />
Because the sum of the two numbers is positive and the two numbers have different signs, it means the absolute value of the positive number is 8 units greater than the absolute value of the negative number. First, we find two positive numbers which are different by 8, which will be the positive values of our numbers.<br />
10 and -2<br />
Our positive number will be greater one while our negative number will be the smaller one (-2). So the desired numbers are:<br />
10 + (-2) = 8<br />
12 + (-4) = 8<br />
15 + (-7) = 8</p>
<p>Question 30.<br />
Multistep Bart and Sam played a game in which each player earns or loses points in each turn. A player’s total score after two turns is the sum of his points earned or lost. The player with the greater score after two turns wins. Bart earned 123 points and lost 180 points. Sam earned 185 points and lost 255 points. Which person won the game? Explain.<br />
____________</p>
<p>Answer: Bart</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
123 + (-180) = -(180 &#8211; 123) = -57<br />
The person who has the greatest number of points after 2 turns win.<br />
We find the number of points Bart has, by adding the number of points from the two turns:<br />
185 + (-255) = -(255 &#8211; 185) &#8211; 70<br />
We find the number of points Sam has, by adding the number of points from the two turns:<br />
The winner is Bart because -57 is greater than -70.</p>

<p>Question 31.<br />
Critical Thinking Explain how you could use a number line to show that -4 + 3 and 3 + (-4) have the same value. Which property of addition states that these sums are equivalent?<br />
____________ Property of Addition</p>
<p>Answer: Commutative property of addition</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
In order to prove that -4 + 3 and 3 + (-4) have the same value we use the number line twice: -1 we start from -4 and we move 3 units in the positive direction to the right we get the sum -1.<br />
We start from 3 and we move 4 units in the negative direction to the left where we find again -1.<br />
The property of addition which states that the sum is the same no matter the order in which we add the terms is called commutative property.</p>

<p>Question 34.<br />
Analyze Relationships You know that the sum of -5 and another integer is a positive integer. What can you conclude about the sign of the other integer? What can you conclude about the value of the other integer? Explain.<br />
Type below:<br />
____________</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
We know that the sum is -5 and another integer is a positive integer. This means that the absolute value of the positive number is greater than the absolute value of -5.<br />
The absolute value of -5 is 5, so the absolute value of the positive integer must be greater than 5. But because the number is positive, its absolute value is the number itself, so the positive number must be greater than 5.<br />
-5 + 7 = 7 &#8211; 5 = 2</p>

Which brand of cat food resulted in the greatest weight loss for Nell’s cat? Explain.<br />
__________</p>
<p>Answer: Diet Chow</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
(-8) + (-18) = -26<br />
We count the total change of weight resulted after using the diet chow for two months.<br />
We count the total change of weight resulted after using the Kitty Diet for two months:<br />
3 + (-19) = -16<br />
This means that by using the Diet Chow the cat lost 26 oz, while using the Kitty Diet she lost 16 oz, thus the greatest loss of weight resulted in using the Diet Chow food.</p>

Draw Conclusions When you subtract one negative integer from another, will your answer be greater than or less than the integer you started with? Explain your reasoning and give an example.<br />
____________ the integer</p>
<p>Answer: Greater</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
When we subtract one negative integer from another we will get an integer which is greater than the integer we started with because subtracting a negative integer from the initial number can be replaced by adding the opposite of that negative integer, which is a positive integer, thus the result will definitely be greater than the initial number.<br />

9, 4, -1, -6, -11, _______ , _______ , _______</p>
<p>Answer: -16, -21, -26</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
We are given the sequence of numbers:<br />
9, 4 , -1, -6, -11,&#8230;<br />
We find the next 3 terms:<br />
-11 &#8211; 5 = -11 + (-5) = -16<br />
-16 &#8211; 5 = 16 + (-5) = -21<br />
-21 &#8211; 5 = -21 + (-5) = -26<br />
Thus the next three terms are -16, -21, -26</p>

<p>Question 1.<br />
Tomas works as an underwater photographer. He starts at a position that is 15 feet below sea level. He rises 9 feet, then descends 12 feet to take a photo of a coral reef. Write and evaluate an expression to find his position relative to sea level when he took the photo.<br />
_______ feet below sea level</p>
<p>Answer: 18 feet</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
When he rises, we add the distance. When he descends, we subtract the distance.<br />
The initial position is -15. We write an expression to find his position relative to sea level when he took the photo:<br />
-15 + 9 &#8211; 12 = (-15) + 9 + (-12)<br />
(-15) + (-12) + 9<br />
-(15 + 12) + 9<br />
-27 + 9 = -18<br />
Thus he was 18 feet below sea level when he took the photo.</p>
<p>Question 2.<br />
The temperature on a winter night was -23 °F. The temperature rose by 5 °F when the sun came up. When the sun set again, the temperature dropped by 7 °F. Write and evaluate an expression to find the temperature after the sun set.<br />
_______ °F</p>
<p>Answer: -25</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
When the temperature rises, we add the temperature. When the temperature drops, we subtract the temperature. The initial temperature is -23.<br />
We write an expression to find the temperature after the sunset:<br />
-23 + 5 &#8211; 7 = -(23 + 7) + 5<br />
-30 + 5 = -25<br />
Thus the temperature is -25°F after the sunset.</p>

_______ points</p>
<p>Answer: 67 points</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
When he wins, we add points. When he loses, we subtract points.<br />
The score is 50 points. We write the expression to find the final score:<br />
50 &#8211; 40 + 87 &#8211; 30<br />
50 + (-40) + 87 + (-30)<br />
50 + 87 &#8211; (40 + 30)<br />
137 &#8211; 70 = 67<br />
Thus his final is 67 points.</p>

a. During which hour did more customers leave than arrive?<br />
___________</p>
<p>Answer: 3:00 &#8211; 4:00</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
since in the last column the only positive value is in the last position, the hour in which more customers leave than arrive is 3:00 &#8211; 4:00</p>
<p>Question 17.<br />
b. There were 75 customers in the store at 1:00. The store must be emptied of customers when it closes at 5:00. How many customers must leave the store between 4:00 and 5:00?<br />
_______ customers</p>
<p>Answer: 87</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
75 + 30 &#8211; 12 + 14 &#8211; 8 + 18 &#8211; 30<br />
75 + 30 + 14 + 18 &#8211; (12 + 8 + 30)<br />
137 &#8211; 50 = 87<br />
Since there are 87 customers in the store at 4:00 and the store must be emptied at 5:00, the number of clients who must leave is 87.</p>

Carla had $100 in her account in May. How much money does she have in her account in August?<br />
$ _______</p>
<p>Answer: $51</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
We are given the data:<br />
100 &#8211; 18 + 22 &#8211; 53<br />
100 + 22 -(18 + 53)<br />
122 &#8211; 71 = 51<br />
Thus Carla saved $51 in her account in August.</p>
<p>Question 19.<br />
Leta had $45 in her account in May. How much money does she have in her account in August?<br />
$ _______</p>
<p>Answer: $24</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
We are given the data:<br />
45 &#8211; 17 &#8211; 22 + 18<br />
45 + 18 -(17 + 22)<br />
63 &#8211; 39 = 24<br />
Thus Leta saved $24 in her account in August.</p>
<p>Question 20.<br />
Analyze Relationships Whose account had the greatest decrease in value from May to August?<br />
___________</p>
<p>Answer: Carla&#8217;s account</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Carla had $100 in May and $51 in august, thus her account&#8217;s change is:<br />
51 &#8211; 100 = -49<br />
Leta had $45 in May and $24 in august, thus her accounts change is:<br />
24 &#8211; 45 = -21<br />
Carla&#8217;s account had a decrease of $49, while Leta&#8217;s account decreased by $21, so the account with the greatest decrease is Carla&#8217;s.</p>

<p>A diver leaves from a point situated 1 meter below the sea level. First, he dives 6 meters, then he rises 3 meters and stops. At which level under the sea level does he stop?<br />
We start from the initial point -1, we add distance if he rises and we subtract distance when he dives. We determine the final level under the sea level where he stops:<br />
-1 &#8211; 6 + 3<br />
-(1 + 6) + 3<br />
-7 + 3 = -4<br />
-4 or 4 meters below the sea level.</p>

Does Mary have enough money to pay her parents what she owes them? If not, how much more money does she need? Explain.<br />
_______</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
The initial point is 10. We add money when she is paid for chores, gets presents. We determine,ine the amount of money she has after she gets money from chores and presents:<br />
10 + 12 + 25 = 47<br />
47 &lt; 50<br />
50 &#8211; 47 = 3<br />
Thus she needs $3.</p>
<p>Question 23.<br />
Draw Conclusions An expression involves subtracting two numbers from a positive number. Under what circumstances will the value of the expression be negative? Give an example.<br />
Type below:<br />
___________</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
The sum of the two numbers to be subtracted from the positive number is a number, we will study this first. Since we subtract this number from the positive number and we get a negative number, it means that the number is greater than the positive number, therefore mandatory positive. This means the two numbers cannot be both negative.<br />
Example:<br />
10 &#8211; (7 + 5) = 10 &#8211; 12 = -2<br />
-2 &lt; 0</p>

<p>Question 10.<br />
A bus makes a stop at 2:30, letting off 15 people and letting on 9. The bus makes another stop ten minutes later to let off 4 more people. How many more or fewer people are on the bus after the second stop compared to the number of people on the bus before the 2:30 stop?<br />
_______ people</p>
<p>Answer: 10</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Assume that the total passengers on the bus before 2:30 was x<br />
15 passengers got off and 9 got on.<br />
number of passengers = x &#8211; 15 + 9<br />
number of passengers = x -6<br />
4 passengers got off the bus<br />
number of passengers = (x-6) &#8211; 4<br />
number of passengers = x &#8211; 10<br />
The original number of passengers on the bus decreased by 10 after the second stop.</p>
