The students in two third-grade classes recorded their favorite school subject. The data are in the tally table. How many fewer students chose science than chose social studies as their favorite school subject?<br />
Think: Use the data in the tally table to record the data in the frequency table. Then solve the problem.<br />
social studies: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">12</span> students<br />
science: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">5</span> students<br />
12 – 5 = <span style="text-decoration: underline;">7</span><br />
So, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">7</span> fewer students chose science.</p>

<p>Question 2.<br />
What subject did the least number of students choose?<br />
___________</p>
<p>Answer: Science</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>We can answer the question by using the above tally table. The table shows the least number of students is 5. Thus the answer is Science.</p>
<p>Question 3.<br />
How many more students chose math than language arts as their favorite subject?<br />
_______ more students</p>
<p>Answer: 4</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>If we look at the above table, there are 11 students who chose Math and 7 students who chose the language arts</p>
<p>To know the students who chose math than language arts we have to subtract 11 and 7<br />
= 11 &#8211; 7<br />
= 4<br />
Thus the students chose math than language arts as their favorite subject are 4</p>
<p>Question 4.<br />
Suppose 3 students changed their vote from math to science. Describe how the frequency table would change.</p>
<p>Type below:<br />
__________</p>
<p>Answer: There would be an equal number of students who chose math and who chose science</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>If we look at the graph there are 11 students who voted for Math and 5 students who voted for Science<br />
If 3 students changed their vote from math to science then the new graph will be</p>
<p>11- 3= 8<br />
i.e., Actual No. of Science Students + New Students who changed from Math to Science<br />
= 5 + 3<br />
= 8</p>

<p>Question 2.<br />
There are 472 people in the concert hall. What is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">4</span>72 rounded to the nearest hundred?<br />
Options:<br />
a. 400<br />

<p>Question 1.<br />
How many students scored 100? How can you find the answer?</p>
<p>Answer: To find the number of students who scored 100, count each star as 4 students. So, 20 students scored 100.</p>
<p>Question 2.<br />
What does <img src="https://i1.wp.com/gomathanswerkey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Go-Math-Grade-3-Answer-Key-Chapter-2-Represent-and-Interpret-Data-img-4.jpg?resize=34%2C40&#038;ssl=1" alt="Go Math Grade 3 Answer Key Chapter 2 Represent and Interpret Data Use Picture Graph img 4" width="34" height="40" data-recalc-dims="1" /> stand for?<br />
________ students</p>
<p>Answer: It represents 2 students.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>The full star stands for 4 students<br />
That means the half star is equal to two stars.</p>
<p>Question 3.<br />
How many students in all scored 100 or 95?<br />
________ students</p>
<p>Answer: 32 Students</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>No. of students who scored 100 = 5 stars<br />
Each star = 4 students<br />
i.e., 5 × 4 = 20 students<br />
No. of students who scored 95 = 3<br />
Each star = 4 students<br />
That means 3 × 4 = 12<br />
Total No. of students in all scored 100 or 95<br />
12 + 20 = 32<br />
Thus the answer is 32 students</p>
<p>Question 4.<br />
How many more students scored 90 than 85?<br />
________ students</p>
<p>Answer: 10 more students</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Students who scored 90 = 3 and a half star = 4 + 4 + 4 + 2<br />
Students who score 85 = 1 star = 4<br />
That means students scored 90 than 85 are<br />
14 &#8211; 4 = 10 students</p>
<p>Question 5.<br />
How many students in all took the test?<br />
________ students</p>
<p>Answer: 50 Students</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Students who scored 100 (5 stars) = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20 student<br />
Students who scored 95 (3 stars) = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 students<br />
Students who scored 90 (3 and a half star) = 4 + 4 + 4 + 2 = 14 students<br />
Students who score 85 (1 star) = 4 students<br />
Total No. of students who took test = 20 + 12 + 14 + 4 = 50 students</p>
<p><strong><em>Problem Solving</em></strong></p>
<p>Question 6.<br />
Suppose the students who scored 85 and 90 on the math test take the test again and score 95. How many stars would you have to add to the picture graph next to 95?<br />
Type below:<br />
__________</p>
<p>Answer: 4 Stars and half of a star</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Students who scored 90 = 3 and a half star<br />
Students who score 85 = 1 star<br />
That means students scored 90 than 85 = 4 and a half star<br />
Thus 4 and a half star stars would you have to add to the picture graph next to 95</p>
<p>Question 7.<br />
If 2 more students took the math test and both made a score of 80, what would the picture graph look like?<br />
Type below:<br />
__________</p>
<p>Answer: There would be another row below 85. There would be half of a star next to 80.</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>There would be 5 lines and the 5th line will contain a half star</p>

Each <img src="https://i0.wp.com/gomathanswerkey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Go-Math-Grade-3-Answer-Key-Chapter-2-Represent-and-Interpret-Data-img-15.jpg?resize=26%2C25&#038;ssl=1" alt="Go Math Grade 3 Answer Key Chapter 2 Represent and Interpret Data Mid-Chapter Checkpoint img 15" width="26" height="25" data-recalc-dims="1" /> = 10 students<br />
= 10+10+10+10+10+10 = 60 students<br />
Total students chose camping = 5<br />
10+10+10+10+10 = 50 students<br />
60+50 = 110 students<br />
Next, we need to find how many students chose biking and canoeing<br />
Total students chose canoeing = 3 <img src="https://i0.wp.com/gomathanswerkey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Go-Math-Grade-3-Answer-Key-Chapter-2-Represent-and-Interpret-Data-img-15.jpg?resize=26%2C25&#038;ssl=1" alt="Go Math Grade 3 Answer Key Chapter 2 Represent and Interpret Data Mid-Chapter Checkpoint img 15" width="26" height="25" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
= 10+10+10 = 30 students<br />
Total students chose biking = 3 and a half picture<br />
10+10+10+5 = 35<br />
Add both, we get<br />
30+35 = 65 students<br />
Then, we need to subtract<br />
110 &#8211; 65 = 45 students<br />
Therefore the students choose swimming and camping combined than biking and canoeing = 45 students</p>

Complete the table and explain how you found the answer.</p>
<p>Answer: 7 boys</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Total Number of students = 25<br />
Now we have to add the number of students from the table<br />
4 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 18 students<br />
Next, subtract 18 from the total number of students, 25, to find x<br />
25 &#8211; 18 = 7<br />

<p>Question 3.<br />
How many tickets were sold altogether? Explain how you found the total.<br />
________ tickets</p>
<p>Answer: 100 tickets</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Number of tickets sold in Ms. Brown&#8217;s Class = 9 ✓<br />
Each tick = 5 tickets<br />
5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5 = 45 tickets<br />
Number of tickets sold in Mrs. Gold&#8217;s Class = 5 ✓<br />
5+5+5+5+5 = 25 tickets<br />
Number of ticks sold in Mr. Castro&#8217;s Class = 6 ✓<br />
Each tick = 5 tickets<br />
5+5+5+5+5+5 = 30<br />
Now, we have to add the total number of tickets sold = 45 + 25 + 30 = 100 tickets</p>
<p>Question 4.<br />
Choose the name from each box that makes the sentence true.<br />
Five fewer tickets were sold by <img src="https://i2.wp.com/gomathanswerkey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Go-Math-Grade-3-Answer-Key-Chapter-2-Represent-and-Interpret-Data-img-29.jpg?resize=122%2C124&#038;ssl=1" alt="Go Math Grade 3 Answer Key Chapter 2 Represent and Interpret Data Review/Test img 29" width="122" height="124" data-recalc-dims="1" /> class than <img src="https://i2.wp.com/gomathanswerkey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Go-Math-Grade-3-Answer-Key-Chapter-2-Represent-and-Interpret-Data-img-30.jpg?resize=122%2C124&#038;ssl=1" alt="Go Math Grade 3 Answer Key Chapter 2 Represent and Interpret Data Review/Test img 30" width="122" height="124" data-recalc-dims="1" /> class.<br />
Type below:<br />
________</p>
<p>Answer: Mrs. Gold&#8217;s Class than Mr. Castro&#8217;s Class</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Number of tickets sold in Mrs. Gold&#8217;s Class = 5 ✓<br />
5+5+5+5+5 = 25 tickets<br />
Number of ticks sold in Mr. Castro&#8217;s Class = 6 ✓<br />
Each tick = 5 tickets<br />
5+5+5+5+5+5 = 30<br />
Subtract Number of tickets sold in Mrs. Gold&#8217;s from Mr. Castro&#8217;s Class<br />
We get 30 &#8211; 25 = 5 tickets</p>
<p>Question 5.<br />
How many more tickets were sold by Ms. Brown’s class than Mr. Castro’s class?<br />
_______ tickets</p>
<p>Answer: 15 tickets</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Each tick = 5 tickets<br />
Number of tickets sold in Ms. Brown&#8217;s Class = 9 ✓<br />
5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5 = 45 tickets<br />
Number of ticks sold in Mr. Castro&#8217;s Class = 6 ✓<br />
5+5+5+5+5+5 = 30<br />
Now subtract Number of ticks sold in Mr. Castro&#8217;s from Ms. Brown&#8217;s Class<br />
45 &#8211; 30 = 15 tickets</p>
<p>Question 6.<br />
What if Mrs. Gold’s class sold 20 more tickets? Draw a picture to show how the graph would change.<br />
Type below:<br />
_________</p>
<p>Answer: 20 tickets mean 5 + 5 + 5 + 5, or 4 ✓</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-922" src="https://i1.wp.com/gomathanswerkey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Chapter-2-Answer-Key-for-Go-Math-Grade-3-Review-solution-image_1.jpg?resize=300%2C225&#038;ssl=1" alt="Chapter 2 Answer Key for Go Math Grade 3 Review solution image_1" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/gomathanswerkey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Chapter-2-Answer-Key-for-Go-Math-Grade-3-Review-solution-image_1.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/gomathanswerkey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Chapter-2-Answer-Key-for-Go-Math-Grade-3-Review-solution-image_1.jpg?w=318&amp;ssl=1 318w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p>Question 8.<br />
Each tank can hold up to 20 fish. How many more fish can the Pet Shop put in the three tanks?<br />
Options:<br />
a. 60 fish<br />
b. 23 fish<br />
c. 20 fish<br />
d. 33 fish</p>
<p>Answer: 23 fishes</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>Given that each tank can hold up to 20 fishes<br />
Total number of tanks = 3<br />
20+20+20 = 60 fishes<br />
From the above table, we observe that<br />
Tank 1 contains 16 fishes<br />
Tank 2 contains 9 fishes<br />
Tank 3 contains 12 fishes<br />
Total number of fishes that all tanks contain = 12+16+9 = 37 fishes<br />
Now, we have to subtract the number of fishes that all tanks contain from the number of fishes pet shop put in the three tanks<br />
= 60 &#8211; 37 = 23 fishes</p>

<p>Question 9.<br />
Three more students play the piano than which other instrument?<br />
__________</p>
<p>Answer: Flute</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>The above bar graph shows the number of students who play musical instruments<br />
From the graph, we observe that the number of students who play the flute is 6<br />
And the number of students who play the piano is 9<br />
Subtract Number of students play flute from piano<br />
We get,<br />
9 &#8211; 6 = 3<br />
Thus the answer is Flute</p>
<p>Question 10.<br />
The same number of students play which two instruments?<br />
__________<br />
__________</p>
<p>Answer: Drums and Guitar</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>The graphs the students who play drums and guitar are the same<br />
Because the no. of students who play guitar = 10<br />
And the no. of students who play drums = 10</p>
<p>Question 11.<br />
For numbers 11a–11d, select True or False for each statement.<br />
a. Ten more students play guitar than play flute.<br />
i. True<br />
ii. False</p>
<p>Answer: False</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>No. of students who play guitar = 10<br />
No. of students who play flute = 6<br />
The statement is not correct<br />
So, the answer is false</p>
<p>Question 11.<br />
b. Nine students play piano.<br />
i. True<br />
ii. False</p>
<p>Answer: True</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>The bar graph given in the above shows that the number of students who play piano is 9. So, the answer is true.</p>
<p>Question 11.<br />
c. Six fewer students play flute and piano combined than play drums and guitar combined.<br />
i. True<br />
ii. False</p>
<p>Answer: False</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>No. of students who play guitar = 10<br />
No. of students who play drums = 10<br />
No. of students who play flute = 6<br />
No. of students who play piano = 9<br />
Now, add the number of students who play flute and piano = 6+9 = 15<br />
Next, add the No. of students who play drums and guitar = 10+10 = 20<br />
The difference between them is 5, not 6<br />
So, the answer is false</p>
<p>Question 11.<br />
d. Nine more students play piano and guitar combined than play drums.<br />
i. True<br />
ii. False</p>
<p>Answer: True</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>No. of students who play piano = 9<br />
No. of students who play guitar = 10<br />
Total = 10+9 = 19 students<br />
No. of students who play drums = 10<br />
Subtract No. of students who play drums from total students who play piano and guitar combined<br />
That means 19 &#8211; 10 = 9<br />
Therefore the  answer is true</p>

<p>Question 13.<br />
Part B<br />
How do you know how long to make the bars on your graph? How did you show 15 votes for broccoli? Explain.<br />
Type below:<br />
_________</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>By reading Karen&#8217;s frequency table we can see that the number of votes for each favorite vegetable.<br />
15 lies between 10 and 20. So, the bar should be drawn all the way to the midpoint between 10 and 20.</p>
<p>Question 14.<br />
How many more votes did the two most popular vegetables get than the two least popular vegetables? Explain how you solved the problem.<br />
________ votes</p>
<p>Answer: 35 votes</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>The two most popular vegetables are carrots and corn<br />
And the number of votes for carrots and corn are 40 and 20<br />
40+20 = 60 votes<br />
The two least popular vegetables are broccoli and green beans<br />
And the number of votes for broccoli and green beans are 15 and 10<br />
15+10 = 25 votes<br />
Now, Subtract the number of votes for broccoli and green beans from a number of votes for carrots and corn<br />
60-25 = 35 students</p>
