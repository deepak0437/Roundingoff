          <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1069" src="https://i0.wp.com/gomathanswerkey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GO-Math-Grade-3-Understand-Multiplication-Spiral-Review-Page-No-156-Answer-12-i.png?resize=140%2C139&#038;ssl=1" alt="GO Math Grade 3 Understand Multiplication Spiral Review Page No 156 Answer 12 - i" width="140" height="139" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
          Since 4 &lt; 5, the digit in the rounding place stays same. i.e, 3<br />
          Now, write zeros to the right of the rounding place (tens and ones place)<br />
