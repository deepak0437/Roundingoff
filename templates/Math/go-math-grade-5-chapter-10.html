Cory brings five 1-gallon jugs of juice to serve during parent night at his school. If the paper cups he is using for drinks can hold 8 fluid ounces, how many drinks can Cory serve for parent night?<br />
_____ drinks</p>
<p>Answer: 80 drinks</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
First, convert from gallons to quarts<br />
We are converting larger unit to the smaller unit.<br />
1 gal = 4 qt<br />
We need to multiply by the conversion rule.<br />

<p>Question 15.<br />
Kelly made one batch of peanut and pretzel snack mix. How many grams does she need to add to the snack mix to make 2 kilograms?<br />
_____ g</p>
<p>Answer: 575 grams</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Kelly made one batch of peanut and pretzel snack mix.<br />
From the above figure, we can see that batch of peanut and pretzel snack mix is 1425 grams<br />
To find how many grams she needs to add to the snack mix to make 2 kilograms<br />
We have to subtract 1425 grams from 2 kgs<br />
1 kg = 1000 grams<br />
2 kg = 2000 grams<br />
2000 g &#8211; 1425 g = 575 grams<br />
Thus she needs to add 575 grams to make 2 kilograms.</p>
<p>Question 16.<br />

<p>Explanation:<br />
Erin’s water bottle holds 600 milliliters of water.<br />
Dylan’s water bottle holds 1 liter of water.<br />
First, convert from liter to milliliters<br />
1 liter = 1000 milliliters<br />
By this, we can say that Dylan’s water bottle has a greater capacity.</p>
<p>Question 18.<br />

<p>Explanation:<br />
Liz and Alana each participated in the high jump at the track meet.<br />
Liz’s high jump was 1 meter.<br />
Alana’s high jump was 132 centimeters.<br />
Convert from centimeters to meter.<br />
1 meter = 100 cm<br />
132 cm = 132 ÷ 100 meter<br />
132 cm = 1.32 m<br />
1 m is less than 1.32 m<br />
Alana jumped higher than Liz.</p>

<p>Answer:<br />
Groove Box<br />
Internet -C</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
From the above figure, we can observe that the Internet services downloaded the podcast in less than 4 minutes is Groove Box and Internet -C<br />
Groove box took 173 sec and Internet-C took 196 seconds.<br />
Convert from minutes to seconds<br />
1 min = 60 sec<br />
1 sec= 1/60 min<br />
173 sec = 2 min 53 sec<br />
196 sec = 180 sec + 16 sec = 3 min 16 sec</p>
<p>Question 16.<br />
Which service took the longest to download the podcast? How much longer did it take than Red Fox in minutes and seconds?<br />
Type below:<br />
_________</p>
<p>Answer: Top Hat</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
The figure shows that Top Hat took the longest time to download the podcast.<br />
It took 1050 sec to download the podcast.<br />
Convert from minutes to seconds<br />
1 min = 60 sec<br />
1 sec= 1/60 min<br />
1050 sec = 1020 sec 30 sec<br />
1020 sec = 1020 × 1/60 min = 17 min<br />
1050 sec = 17 min 30 sec.<br />
To find how much time it took than Red Fox, we need to subtract the time from red fox and top hat.<br />
1050 sec &#8211; 310 sec = 740 sec<br />
Convert from seconds to minutes.<br />
1 min = 60 sec<br />
1 sec = 1/60 min<br />
740 sec = 720 + 20 sec<br />
720 sec = 720 × 1/60 = 12 min<br />
740 sec = 12 min 20 sec</p>
<p>Question 17.<br />

Internet-C took 196 sec<br />
Red Fox took 310 sec<br />
310 sec &#8211; 196 sec = 114 sec<br />
Convert from seconds to minutes.<br />
1 min = 60 sec<br />
1 sec = 1/60 min<br />
114 sec = 60 sec + 54 sec<br />
114 sec = 1 min 54 sec</p>
