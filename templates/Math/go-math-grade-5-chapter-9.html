<p>Lilly needs to buy beads for a necklace. The beads are sold by mass. She sketches a design to determine what beads are needed and then writes down their sizes. The sizes are shown below.<br />
<img src="https://i2.wp.com/gomathanswerkey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Go-Math-Grade-5-Answer-Key-Chapter-9-Algebra-Patterns-and-Graphing-img-1.jpg?resize=307%2C149&#038;ssl=1" alt="Go Math Grade 5 Answer Key Chapter 9 Algebra Patterns and Graphing img 1" width="307" height="149" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
\(\frac{2}{5} g, \frac{2}{5} g, \frac{4}{5} g, \frac{2}{5} g, \frac{1}{5} g, \frac{1}{5} g, \frac{3}{5} g, \frac{4}{5} g, \frac{1}{5} g, \frac{2}{5} g, \frac{3}{5} g, \frac{3}{5} g, \frac{2}{5} g\)<br />
Think: There are ___ Xs above \(\frac{1}{5}\) on the line plot, so the combined mass of the beads is _____ fifths, or _____ gram.</p>
<p>Question 1.<br />
What is the combined mass of the beads with a mass of 1/5 gram?<br />
\(\frac{□}{□}\) grams</p>
<p>Answer: \(\frac{3}{5}\) grams</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
For first we will count the number of \(\frac{1}{5}\) grams for each amount. Draw an x for the number of times each amount is recorded to complete the line plot.<br />
There are 3 xs above \(\frac{1}{5}\) on the line plot, so the combined mass of the beads is 3 fifths<br />
3 × \(\frac{1}{5}\) = 3/5 gram.</p>
<p>Question 2.<br />
What is the combined mass of all the beads with a mass of \(\frac{2}{5}\) gram?<br />
_____ grams</p>
<p>Answer: 2</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
For first we will count the number of \(\frac{2}{5}\) grams for each amount. Draw an x for the number of times each amount is recorded to complete the line plot.<br />
There are 5 xs above \(\frac{2}{5}\) on the line plot, so the combined mass of the beads is 5 two fifths.<br />
5 × \(\frac{2}{5}\) = 2 grams</p>
<p>Question 3.<br />
What is the combined mass of all the beads on the necklace?<br />
_____ grams</p>
<p>Answer: 6</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Total mass of all the beads on the necklace is \(\frac{3}{5}\) + 2 + \(\frac{8}{5}\) + \(\frac{9}{5}\) = \(\frac{30}{5}\) = 6<br />
Therefore the combined mass of all the beads on the necklace is 6.</p>
<p>Question 4.<br />
What is the average weight of the beads on the necklace?<br />
\(\frac{□}{□}\) grams</p>
<p>Answer: \(\frac{3}{7}\) grams</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Divide the sum by the number of beads to find the average.<br />
The number of beads = 3 + 5 + 3 + 2 = 14<br />
Divide by 6.<br />
6 ÷ 14 = 3/7<br />
So, the average mass of the beads on the necklace is 3/7 gram.</p>

\(\frac{3}{2}\) = 1 \(\frac{1}{2}\) cups</p>
<p>Question 8.<br />
How much milk is used in all the orders of pancakes?<br />
_____ cups</p>
<p>Answer: 5 cups</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
\(\frac{1}{2} c\) + [/latex]\frac{1}{4} c[/latex] + [/latex]\frac{1}{2} c[/latex] + [/latex]\frac{3}{4} c[/latex] + [/latex]\frac{1}{2} c[/latex] + [/latex]\frac{3}{4} c[/latex] + [/latex]\frac{1}{2} c[/latex] +[/latex]\frac{1}{4} c[/latex] + [/latex]\frac{1}{2} c[/latex] + [/latex]\frac{1}{2} c[/latex]<br />
= 3 + [/latex]\frac{1}{4} c[/latex] + [/latex]\frac{3}{4} c[/latex] + [/latex]\frac{3}{4} c[/latex] + [/latex]\frac{1}{4} c[/latex]<br />

<p>Answer: The above table says that the X-Axis is Month and Y-Axis is Height in inches.<br />
Scale is 1 cm = 5 inches.</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
The horizontal axis could represent months from 1 to 4. In this case, the scale interval is one month.<br />
The vertical axis could represent height from 20 inches to 32 inches but we can show a break in the scale between 1 inch and 16 inches since there are no heights between 0 inches and 20 inches, the scale interval is 1 inch.</p>

<p>Question 3.<br />
How many kittens weigh at least \(\frac{3}{8}\) of a pound?<br />
______ kittens</p>
<p>Answer: 9</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
The line plot shows that there are 4 xs above \(\frac{3}{8}\), 3 xs above \(\frac{1}{2}\) and 2 xs on \(\frac{5}{8}\).<br />
To find the kittens weigh at least \(\frac{3}{8}\) we need to add all above \(\frac{3}{8}\)<br />
= 4 + 3 + 2 = 9</p>
<p>Question 4.<br />
What is the combined weight of all the kittens?<br />
______ lb</p>
<p>Answer: 5</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
There are 3 xs above 1/4 on the line plot, so the combined weight of Kitten in the animal shelter is 3 fourths<br />
3 × 1/4 = 3/4.<br />
There are 4 xs above 3/8 on the line plot, so the combined weight of kittens in the animal shelter is 4 three eights or<br />
4 × 3/8 = 12/8 = 3/2<br />
There are 3 xs above 1/2 on the line plot, so the combined weight of kittens in the animal shelter is 3 halves = 3/2<br />
There are 2 xs above 5/8 on the line plot, so the combined weight of kittens in the animal shelter is 10/8<br />
3/4 + 1 4/8 + 1 1/2 + 1 2/8<br />
= 3/4 + 12/8 + 3/2 + 10/8 = 6/8 + 12/8 + 12/8 + 10/8 = 40/8 = 5 lb</p>
<p>Question 5.<br />
What is the average weight of the kittens in the shelter?<br />
______ lb</p>
<p>Answer: 5/12</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Divide the sum you found in example 4. 5 lb by the number of the kittens to find the average. The number of kittens is 12 so we will divide 5 lb by 12.<br />
5 ÷ 12 = 5/12.<br />
Thus the average weight of the kittens in the shelter as 5/12 lb.</p>

______ \(\frac{□}{□}\) miles</p>
<p>Answer: 2 \(\frac{1}{6}\) miles</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
There are 3 xs above \(\frac{1}{3}\) = 3 × \(\frac{1}{3}\) = 1<br />
There are 1 x above \(\frac{1}{2}\) = 1 × \(\frac{1}{2}\) = \(\frac{1}{2}\)<br />
There is 1 x above \(\frac{2}{3}\) = 1 × \(\frac{2}{3}\) = \(\frac{2}{3}\)<br />
1 + \(\frac{2}{3}\) + \(\frac{1}{2}\) = (6 + 3 + 4)/6 = 13/6<br />
The mixed fraction of 13/6 is 2 \(\frac{1}{6}\) miles<br />
Thus she walked 2 \(\frac{1}{6}\) miles in 5 days.</p>

<p>Question 7.<br />
Emily has a road map with a key that shows an inch on the map equals 5 miles of actual distance. If a distance measured on the map is 12 inches, what is the actual distance? Write the rule you used to find the actual distance.<br />
______ miles</p>
<p>Answer: 60 miles</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
For first the total length of roads is 5 inches + 7 inches = 12 inches<br />
1 inch on the map represents 5 miles of actual distance so to find what actual distance corresponding to 12 inches we will find with using proportion.<br />
1 inch : 5 inches = 12 inches: x inches<br />
1 × x = 5 × 12<br />
x = 60 miles<br />
The actual distance which Emily will drive is 60 miles.<br />
The rule which we used to find the actual distance is multiplied by 5 which is a mark in solution.</p>

To make a shade of lavender paint, Jon mixes 4 ounces of red tint and 28 ounces of blue tint into one gallon of white paint. If 20 gallons of white paint and 80 ounces of red tint are used, how much blue tint should be added? Write a rule that you can use to find the amount of blue tint needed.<br />
______ oz</p>
<p>Answer: 560 oz</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
For one gallon of white paint, Jon mixed 28 ounces of blue tint so to find how much tint corresponding to 20 gallons of white paint we will find with using proportion.<br />
1 gallon of white paint:28 ounces of blue tint = 20 gallons of white paint:x ounces of the blue tint.<br />
1 × x = 28 × 20<br />
x = 560<br />
560 ounces of blue tint should be added.<br />
The rule which we used to find the amount of blue tint needed is to multiply by 28 which is the mark in solution.</p>
<p>Question 9.<br />
In the cafeteria, tables are arranged in groups of 4, with each table seating 8 students. How many students can sit at 10 groups of tables? Write the rule you used to find the number of students.<br />

<p>Answer: 320 students</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Tables are arranged in groups of 4, with each table seating 8 students, so in one group sit<br />
4 × 8 = 32 students<br />
To find how many students can sit at 10 groups of tables, we will find when multiplying 32 students with 10.<br />
32 × 10 = 320<br />
Finally, 320 students can sit at 10 groups of tables. The rule which we used to find the number of students is to multiply by 32 which is marked is a solution.</p>

$ ______</p>
<p>Answer: 1000</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
The possible rule for Hour Worked: We can see that the difference between terms is 2.<br />
So, the rule which describes this is Add 2.<br />
The possible rule for Jane&#8217;s Pay: We can see that the difference between terms is 50.<br />
So, the rule which describes this is Add 50.<br />
Jane&#8217;s Pay is 25 times the hours worked so, we will multiply the hours worked by 25 to find Jane&#8217;s Pay.<br />
The unknown number Jane&#8217;s Pay we will find when multiplying 40 with 25:<br />
40 × 25 = 1000<br />
She earns 1000 dollars.</p>

<img src="https://i0.wp.com/gomathanswerkey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Go-Math-Grade-5-Answer-Key-Chapter-9-Algebra-Patterns-and-Graphing-img-39.jpg?resize=277%2C96&#038;ssl=1" alt="Go Math Grade 5 Answer Key Chapter 9 Algebra Patterns and Graphing img 39" width="277" height="96" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
$ ______</p>
<p>Answer: 120</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Possible rule for Tokens: We can see that the difference between terms is 8.<br />
So, the rule which describes this is Add 8.<br />
Possible rule for Games: We can see that the difference between terms is 4.<br />
So, the rule which describes this is Add 4.<br />
Tokens are 2 times the games so, we will divide the tokens by 2 to find how many games can she3 play.<br />
The unknown number of games we will find when dividing 120 with 2:<br />
120 ÷ 2 = 60<br />
She can play 60 games for 120 tokens.</p>
<p>Question 6.<br />
Paul is taking a taxicab to a museum. The taxi driver charges a $3 fee plus $2 for each mile traveled. How much does the ride to the museum cost if it is 8 miles away?</p>
<p>Answer: $40</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Paul is taking a taxicab to a museum. The taxi driver charges a $3 fee plus $2 for each mile traveled.<br />
That means the driver charged $5 per mile.<br />
For 8 miles = 8 × $5 = $40.</p>

c. 2 + 4 + 4 + 4<br />
d. 16</p>
<p>Answer: 2 + 4 + 4 + 4</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
We can see that the difference between two consecutive figures is 4 squares.<br />
So, the rule which describes this is Add 4.<br />
Thus figure 4 has 14 squares.<br />
Thus the correct answer is option C.</p>

<img src="https://i2.wp.com/gomathanswerkey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Go-Math-Grade-5-Answer-Key-Chapter-9-Algebra-Patterns-and-Graphing-img-49.jpg?resize=367%2C262&#038;ssl=1" alt="Go Math Grade 5 Answer Key Chapter 9 Algebra Patterns and Graphing img 49" width="367" height="262" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
Lou and George are making chili for the Annual Firefighter’s Ball. Lou uses 2 teaspoons of hot sauce for every 2 cups of chili that he makes, and George uses 3 teaspoons of the same hot sauce for every cup of chili in his recipe. Who has the hotter chili, George or Lou?</p>
<p>Write the related number pairs as ordered pairs and then graph them. Use the graph to compare who has the hotter chili, George or Lou.<br />
<img src="https://i2.wp.com/gomathanswerkey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Go-Math-Grade-5-Answer-Key-Chapter-9-Algebra-Patterns-and-Graphing-img-50.jpg?resize=287%2C137&#038;ssl=1" alt="Go Math Grade 5 Answer Key Chapter 9 Algebra Patterns and Graphing img 50" width="287" height="137" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />

<p>Elsa said that George’s chili was hotter than Lou’s because the graph showed that the amount of hot sauce in George’s chili was always 3 times as great as the amount of hot sauce in Lou’s chili.</p>
<p>Does Elsa’s answer make sense, or is it nonsense?<br />
Explain.<br />
<img src="https://i2.wp.com/gomathanswerkey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Go-Math-Grade-5-Answer-Key-Chapter-9-Algebra-Patterns-and-Graphing-img-51.jpg?resize=252%2C386&#038;ssl=1" alt="Go Math Grade 5 Answer Key Chapter 9 Algebra Patterns and Graphing img 51" width="252" height="386" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Answer: Elsa&#8217;s Answer makes sense.</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Elsa&#8217;s answer makes sense because the amount of hot sauce in George&#8217;s chili was always 3 times as great as the amount of hot sauce in Lou&#8217;s chili. To prove this we will take two points from the graph which has an equal amount of cups of chili and compares the amount of hot sauce in George&#8217;s chili with the amount of hot sauce in Lou&#8217;s chili.<br />
If we take 4 cups of George&#8217;s chili and Lou&#8217;s chili the amount of hot sauce in George&#8217;s chili is 12 teaspoons and the amount of hot sauce in Lou&#8217;s chili is 4 teaspoons.<br />
12 is 3 times greater than 4 so Elsa&#8217;s answer makes sense.</p>

<p>Question 13.<br />
Mr. Stevens drives 110 miles in 2 hours, 165 miles in 3 hours, and 220 miles in 4 hours. How many miles will he drive in 5 hours?<br />
Explain how the number of hours he drives is related to the number of miles he drives.<br />
_____ miles</p>
<p>Answer: 275 miles</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Given that, Mr. Stevens drives 110 miles in 2 hours, 165 miles in 3 hours, and 220 miles in 4 hours.<br />
We have to divide the number of miles by number of hours<br />
That means, 110/2, 165/3, 220/4<br />
the distance gone in 5 hours can be found with this equation<br />
110/2 x ?/5<br />
multiply 110 by 5 then divide the product by 2<br />
110 × 5= 550<br />
550/2 =275<br />
Thus the answer is Mr. Stevens goes 275 miles in 5 hr.</p>
