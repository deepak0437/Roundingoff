Emilio and Julia used different ways to find \(\frac{1}{2}\) ÷ 4. Emilio used a model to find the quotient. Julia used a related multiplication equation to find the quotient. Whose answer makes sense? Whose answer is nonsense? Explain your reasoning.<br />
Emilio’s Work<br />
<img src="https://i1.wp.com/gomathanswerkey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Go-Math-Grade-5-Answer-Key-Chapter-8-Divide-Fractions-img-4.jpg?resize=215%2C112&#038;ssl=1" alt="Go Math Grade 5 Answer Key Chapter 8 Divide Fractions img 4" width="215" height="112" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
\(\frac{1}{2}\) ÷ 4</p>
<p>Julia’s Work<br />
If \(\frac{1}{2}\) ÷ 4 = ■, then ■ × 4 = \(\frac{1}{2}\)<br />
I know that \(\frac{1}{8}\) ÷ 4 = \(\frac{1}{2}\)<br />
So, \(\frac{1}{2}\) ÷ 4 = \(\frac{1}{8}\) because \(\frac{1}{8}\) × 4 = \(\frac{1}{2}\)<br />
Type below:<br />
____________</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
Julia’s Work is sense.<br />
Emilio&#8217;s work is nonsense.</p>
<p>Question 13.<br />
• For the answer that is nonsense, describe how to find the correct answer.<br />
Type below:<br />
____________</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
Emilio&#8217;s work is nonsense becuase she divided \(\frac{1}{2}\) into two parts i.e., \(\frac{1}{4}\) and \(\frac{1}{4}\).<br />
\(\frac{1}{2}\)/4 = \(\frac{1}{2}\) × \(\frac{1}{4}\)<br />
Emilio must multiply the whole number with the denominator.<br />
\(\frac{1}{2}\) × \(\frac{1}{4}\) = \(\frac{1}{8}\)</p>

<p>Question 1.<br />
A chef has 5 blocks of butter. Each block weighs 1 pound.<br />
She cuts each block into fourths. How many \(\frac{1}{4}\)-pound pieces of butter does the chef have?<br />
First, draw rectangles to represent the blocks of butter.<br />
Then, divide each rectangle into fourths.<br />
Finally, multiply the number of fourths in each block by the number of blocks.<br />
So, the chef has ______ one-fourth-pound pieces of butter.<br />
______ one-fourth-pound</p>
<p>Answer: 20</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Step 1: First form 5 rectangles to represent the blocks of butter. And then divide each rectangle into fourths.<br />
Step 2: Now we will multiply the number of fourths in each block by the number of blocks.<br />
Multiply the fourths with the whole number.<br />
4 × 5 = 20<br />
Thus the chef has 20 one fourth pound pieces of butter.</p>
<p>Question 2.<br />
What if the chef had 3 blocks of butter and cut the blocks into thirds? How many \(\frac{1}{3}\)-pound pieces of butter would the chef have?<br />
______ \(\frac{1}{3}\)-pound</p>
<p>Answer: 9</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Multiply the number of thirds in each block with the number of blocks.<br />
3 × thirds = 3 × 3 = 9<br />
Thus the chef has 9 one third pound pieces of butter.</p>
<p>Question 3.<br />
Jason has 2 pizzas that he cuts into fourths. How many \(\frac{1}{4}\)-size pizza slices does he have?<br />
______ \(\frac{1}{4}\)-size pizza slices</p>
<p>Answer: 8</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Step 1: First, draw 2 circles to represent pizzas. Then divide each circle into fourths.<br />
Step 2: Now multiply the number of fourths in each circle by the number of circles.<br />
4 × 2 = 8<br />
So, Jason has 8 one fourth size pizza slices.</p>

<p>Explanation:<br />
Step 1: First, draw 5 rectangles to represent sandwiches. Then divide each rectangle into thirds.<br />
Step 2: Multiply one third with the number of sandwiches.<br />
3 × 5 = 15<br />
Thomas has 15 one-third sandwich pieces.</p>
<p>Question 5.<br />
Holly cuts 3 pans of brownies into eighths. How many \(\frac{1}{8}\)-size brownie pieces does she have?<br />
______ \(\frac{1}{8}\)-size brownie pieces</p>

<p>Question 7.<br />
Three friends go to a book fair. Allen spends $2.60. Maria spends 4 times as much as Allen. Akio spends $3.45 less than Maria. How much does Akio spend?<br />
$ ______</p>
<p>Answer: $ 6.95</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
To find how much Akio spends for first we will find how much Maria spends, and then subtract 3.45 dollars from that value.<br />
Allen spends 2.60 dollars.<br />
Maris spends 4 times as much as Allen.<br />
4 × 2.60 = 10.4<br />
So, Maria spends 10.4 dollars.<br />
Akio spends for 3.45 dollars less than Maria.<br />
10.4 &#8211; 3.45 = 6.95<br />
So, Akio spends 6.95 dollars.</p>
<p>Question 8.<br />
Brianna has a sheet of paper that is 6 feet long. She cuts the length of paper into sixths and then cuts the length of each of these \(\frac{1}{6}\) pieces into thirds. How many pieces does she have? How many inches long is each piece?<br />
______ pieces , each ______ inches long</p>
<p>Answer: 18 pieces, each 0.33 inches long</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Brianna has a sheet of paper that is 6 feet long.<br />
She cuts the length of paper into sixths and then cuts the length of each of these \(\frac{1}{6}\) pieces into thirds.<br />
Then we will count the one-third pieces to find how many pieces she has.<br />
6 feet ÷18 = 0.33 feet<br />
So, each piece is 0.33 feet long.</p>
<p>Question 9.<br />
Pose a Problem Look back at Problem 8. Write a similar problem by changing the length of the paper and the size of the pieces.<br />
Type below:<br />
____________</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
John has a tree that is 10 feet long. She cuts the length of the tree into tenth and then cuts the length of each of these 1/10 pieces into fourth. How many pieces does he have? How many feet long is each piece?<br />
Answer:<br />
First, draw one rectangle to represent the tree. Then divide this rectangle into tenths, and then we will divide each 1/10 piece into fourths.<br />
Then we will count the one-fourth pieces to find how many pieces he has.<br />
1 tree = 10 feet<br />
10 feet ÷ 40 = 0.4 feet<br />
So, each piece is 0.4 feet long.</p>

<p>Question 11.<br />
Eight students share 12 oatmeal muffins equally and 6 students share 15 apple muffins equally. Carmine is in both groups of students. What is the total number of muffins Carmine gets?<br />
______ muffins</p>
<p>Answer: 4 muffins</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Since Carmine is in both groups of students, for first we will find out how many each student of each group gets.<br />
Now we will find how many oatmeal muffins each of the 8 students get, we will divide the 12 oatmeal muffins by the 8 students.<br />
12 ÷ 8 = \(\frac{12}{8}\) = \(\frac{3}{2}\)<br />
\(\frac{3}{2}\) = 1 \(\frac{1}{2}\)<br />
So, each student shares 1 \(\frac{1}{2}\) oatmeal muffins.<br />
To find how many apple muffins each of the 6 students get we will divide the 15 apple muffins by the 6 students.<br />
15 ÷ 6 = \(\frac{15}{6}\) = \(\frac{5}{2}\)<br />
\(\frac{5}{2}\) = 2 \(\frac{1}{2}\)<br />
As Carmine is in both groups we need to add the total number of muffins<br />
1 \(\frac{1}{2}\)  + 2 \(\frac{1}{2}\) = 4<br />
Therefore the total number of muffins Carmine gets is 4.</p>

<p>Answer:<br />
To find how much longer would it take a three-toed sloth than a giant tortoise to travel 10 feet on the ground, for first we will find how much seconds a three-toed sloth and giant tortoise need to travel 10 feet.<br />
The top speed of a three-toed sloth on the ground is about 1/4 foot per second, so to find how much seconds need a three-toed sloth to travel 10 feet we will find as:<br />
10 feet ÷ 1/4 foot per second = 10 × 4 = 40 seconds<br />
The top speed of a giant tortoise on the ground is about 1/3 foot per second, so to find how much seconds need a giant tortoise to travel 10 feet we will find as:<br />
10 feet ÷ 1/3 foot per second = 10 × 3 = 30 seconds</p>
