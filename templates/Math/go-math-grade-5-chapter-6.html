\(\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{4}=\frac{7}{12}\)<br />
Maya uses \(\frac{1}{12}\) cup of ingredients.<br />
Maya makes trail mix by combining \(\frac{1}{2}\) cup of mixed nuts and \(\frac{1}{3}\) cup of dried fruit and \(\frac{1}{4}\) cup of chocolate morsels. What is the total amount of ingredients in her trail mix?<br />
\(\frac{1}{2}\) + \(\frac{1}{3}\) + \(\frac{1}{4}\) = x<br />
2 • \(\frac{1}{2}\) +  2 • \(\frac{1}{3}\) +  2 • \(\frac{1}{4}\) =  2 • x<br />
1 + \(\frac{2}{3}\) + \(\frac{1}{2}\) = 2x<br />
Now multiply with 3 on both sides<br />
3 • 1 + 3 • \(\frac{2}{3}\) + 3 • \(\frac{1}{2}\) = 3 • 2x<br />
3 + 2 + \(\frac{3}{2}\) = 6x<br />
6 + 4 + 1 = 12 x<br />
11 = 12x<br />
x = \(\frac{11}{12}\)<br />
\(\frac{1}{2}\) + \(\frac{1}{3}\) + \(\frac{1}{4}\) = \(\frac{11}{12}\)</p>

<p>Question 26.<br />
Sara is making a key chain using the bead design shown. What fraction of the beads in her design are either blue or red?<br />
\(\frac{□}{□}\)</p>
<p>Answer: \(\frac{11}{15}\)</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />

The fraction of beads = \(\frac{11}{15}\)</p>
<p>Question 27.<br />
In making the key chain, Sara uses the pattern of beads 3 times. After the key chain is complete, what fraction of the beads in the key chain are either white or blue?<br />
______ \(\frac{□}{□}\)</p>
<p>Answer: 1 \(\frac{4}{5}\)</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
In making the key chain, Sara uses the pattern of beads 3 times.<br />
Given that Sara uses the pattern of beads 3 times.<br />
Total number of blue beads = 5<br />
5 × 3 = 15<br />
Number of white beads = 4<br />
4 × 3 = 12<br />
15 + 12 = 27<br />
Actual number of beads = 15<br />
So, the fraction is \(\frac{27}{15}\) = \(\frac{9}{5}\)<br />
The mixed fraction of \(\frac{9}{5}\) is 1 \(\frac{4}{5}\)</p>

Type below:<br />
_________</p>
<p>Answer: Jamie’s claim is reasonable</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Jamie had \(\frac{4}{5}\) of a spool of twine. He then used \(\frac{1}{2}\) of a spool of twine to make friendship knots. He claims to have \(\frac{3}{10}\) of the original spool of twine left over.<br />
To know whether his estimation is reasonable or not we have to subtract the total spool of twine from used spool of twine.<br />
\(\frac{4}{5}\) &#8211; \(\frac{1}{2}\)<br />
LCD = 10<br />
\(\frac{4}{5}\) × \(\frac{2}{2}\)  &#8211; \(\frac{1}{2}\) × \(\frac{5}{5}\)<br />
\(\frac{8}{10}\) &#8211; \(\frac{5}{10}\) = \(\frac{3}{10}\)<br />
By this is can that Jamie’s claim is reasonable.</p>

_________</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
Gavin plans to mix a batch of Tangerine paint. He expects to have a total of 5 \(\frac{3}{10}\) ounces of paint after he mixes the amounts of red and yellow.<br />
To mix a batch of Tangerine paint he need 3 \(\frac{9}{10}\) red and 2 \(\frac{3}{8}\) yellow paint.<br />
Add the fractions<br />
3 + \(\frac{9}{10}\) + 2 + \(\frac{3}{8}\)<br />
Solving the whole numbers<br />
3 + 2 = 5<br />
\(\frac{9}{10}\) + \(\frac{3}{8}\)<br />
LCD = 40<br />
\(\frac{9}{10}\) + \(\frac{3}{8}\) = \(\frac{36}{40}\) + \(\frac{15}{40}\) = \(\frac{51}{40}\) = 1 \(\frac{11}{40}\)<br />
5 + 1 \(\frac{11}{40}\) = 6 \(\frac{11}{40}\)</p>
<p>Question 27.<br />
For a special project, Gavin mixes the amount of red from one shade of paint with the amount of yellow from a different shade. He mixes the batch so he will have the greatest possible amount of paint. What amounts of red and yellow from which shades are used in the mixture for the special project? Explain your answer.<br />
Type below:<br />
_________</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
Gavin used red paint from mango and yellow paint from Sunrise Orange.<br />
5 \(\frac{5}{6}\) + 3 \(\frac{1}{4}\)<br />
Solving the whole numbers parts<br />
5 + 3 = 8<br />
Solving the fraction part<br />
\(\frac{5}{6}\) + \(\frac{1}{4}\)<br />
LCD = 12<br />
\(\frac{10}{12}\) + \(\frac{3}{12}\) = \(\frac{13}{12}\)<br />
\(\frac{13}{12}\) = 1 \(\frac{1}{12}\)</p>
<p>Question 28.<br />
Gavin needs to make 2 batches of Mango paint. Explain how you could find the total amount of paint Gavin mixed.<br />
Type below:<br />
_________</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
Gavin used Red paint and Yellow Paint to make Mango shade.<br />
For one batch he need to add 5 \(\frac{5}{6}\) + 5 \(\frac{5}{6}\)<br />
Foe 2 batches<br />
5 \(\frac{5}{6}\)+ 5 \(\frac{5}{6}\) + 5 \(\frac{5}{6}\) + 5 \(\frac{5}{6}\)<br />
Solving the whole numbers<br />
5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 20<br />
Solving the fractions part<br />
\(\frac{5}{6}\) + \(\frac{5}{6}\) + \(\frac{5}{6}\) + \(\frac{5}{6}\) = \(\frac{20}{6}\)<br />
= \(\frac{10}{3}\)<br />
Gavin mixed \(\frac{10}{3}\) of paint to make 2 batches of Mango Paint.</p>

Options:<br />
a. 7 \(\frac{1}{10}\) miles<br />
b. 7 \(\frac{7}{10}\) miles<br />
c. 8 \(\frac{1}{10}\) miles<br />
d. 8 \(\frac{7}{10}\) miles</p>
<p>Answer: 8 \(\frac{1}{10}\) miles</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Test Prep Yolanda walked 3 \(\frac{6}{10}\) miles.<br />
Then she walked 4 \(\frac{1}{2}\) more miles.<br />
3 \(\frac{6}{10}\) + 4 \(\frac{1}{2}\) = 3 + \(\frac{6}{10}\) + 4 + \(\frac{1}{2}\)<br />
Add whole numbers<br />
3 + 4 = 7<br />
Add the fractions<br />
\(\frac{6}{10}\) + \(\frac{1}{2}\)<br />
LCD = 10<br />
\(\frac{6}{10}\) + \(\frac{5}{10}\) = \(\frac{11}{10}\)<br />
\(\frac{11}{10}\) = 8 \(\frac{1}{10}\) miles<br />
Thus the correct answer is option C.</p>

<p><strong>Summarize</strong><br />
An amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio, offers 17 amazing roller coasters for visitors to ride. One of the roller coasters runs at 60 miles per hour and has 3,900 feet of twisting track. This coaster also has 3 trains with 8 rows per train. Riders stand in rows of 4, for a total of 32 riders per train.</p>
<p>The operators of the coaster recorded the number of riders on each train during a run. On the first train, the operators reported that 7 \(\frac{1}{4}\) rows were filled. On the second train, all 8 rows were filled, and on the third train, 5 \(\frac{1}{2}\) rows were filled. How many more rows were filled on the first train than on the third train?</p>

<p>Question 19.<br />
Solve the problem above.<br />
Type below:<br />
_________</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
On the first train, the operators reported that 7 \(\frac{1}{4}\) rows were filled.<br />
On the third train, 5 \(\frac{1}{2}\) rows were filled.<br />
7 \(\frac{1}{4}\) &#8211; 5 \(\frac{1}{2}\)<br />
Solving the whole numbers<br />
7 &#8211; 5 = 2<br />
Solving the fractions<br />
\(\frac{1}{4}\) &#8211; \(\frac{1}{2}\) = &#8211; \(\frac{1}{4}\)<br />
2 &#8211; \(\frac{1}{4}\) = 1 \(\frac{3}{4}\)<br />
1 \(\frac{3}{4}\) more rows were filled on the first train than on the third train.</p>
<p>Question 20.<br />
How many rows were empty on the third train? How many additional riders would it take to fill the empty rows? Explain your answer.<br />
Type below:<br />
_________</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
The coaster also has 3 trains with 8 rows per train.<br />
The third train has 8 rows.<br />
On the third train, 5 \(\frac{1}{2}\) rows were filled.<br />
8 &#8211; 5 \(\frac{1}{2}\)<br />
8 &#8211; 5 &#8211; \(\frac{1}{2}\) = 2 \(\frac{1}{2}\)<br />
2 \(\frac{1}{2}\) rows are empty.<br />
So, it takes 10 additional riders to fill the empty rows on the third train.</p>

The difference is \(\frac{3}{16}\)<br />
First time = \(\frac{3}{16}\) mile<br />
Second time = \(\frac{3}{16}\) + \(\frac{3}{16}\) = \(\frac{3}{8}\) mile<br />
Third time = \(\frac{3}{8}\) + \(\frac{3}{16}\) = \(\frac{9}{16}\) mile<br />
Fourth time = \(\frac{9}{16}\) + \(\frac{3}{16}\) = \(\frac{12}{16}\) mile<br />
Fifth time = \(\frac{12}{16}\) + \(\frac{3}{16}\) = \(\frac{15}{16}\) mile<br />
Sixth time = \(\frac{15}{16}\) + \(\frac{3}{16}\) = \(\frac{18}{16}\) mile<br />
\(\frac{18}{16}\) = 1 \(\frac{2}{16}\) = 1 \(\frac{1}{8}\)</p>

c. 3 \(\frac{1}{4}\) gallons<br />
d. 6 \(\frac{7}{8}\) gallons</p>
<p>Answer: 2 \(\frac{7}{8}\) gallons</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
First term = 1 \(\frac{3}{8}\)<br />
The difference is \(\frac{3}{4}\) &#8211; \(\frac{3}{8}\) = \(\frac{3}{8}\)<br />
Second term is 1 \(\frac{3}{8}\) + \(\frac{3}{8}\) = 1 \(\frac{3}{4}\)<br />
Third term = 1 \(\frac{3}{4}\) + \(\frac{3}{8}\) = 1 + 1 \(\frac{1}{8}\) = 2 \(\frac{1}{8}\)<br />
Fourth term = 2 \(\frac{1}{8}\) + \(\frac{3}{8}\) = 2 \(\frac{1}{2}\)<br />
Fifth term = 2 \(\frac{1}{2}\) + \(\frac{3}{8}\) = 2 \(\frac{7}{8}\) gallons<br />

<p>Question 8.<br />
You can buy 2 DVDs for the same price you would pay for 3 CDs selling for $13.20 apiece. Explain how you could find the price of 1 DVD.<br />
$ ______</p>
<p>Answer: $19.8</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
To find what is the price of 1 DVD we will find what is the price of 3 DVDs and then because 2 DVDs price is the same than 3 CDs we can easily find the price of 1 DVD.<br />
$13.20 × 3 = $39.6<br />
We will divide $39.6 by 2.<br />
$39.6 ÷ 2 = $19.8<br />
The price of 1 DVD is $19.8</p>

b. about 4 \(\frac{1}{2}\) cups<br />
c. about 5 cups<br />
d. about 5 \(\frac{1}{2}\) cups</p>
<p>Answer: about 4 \(\frac{1}{2}\) cups</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Ursula mixed 3 \(\frac{1}{8}\) cups of dry ingredients with 1 \(\frac{2}{5}\) cups of liquid ingredients.<br />
3 + 1 = 4<br />
\(\frac{1}{8}\) is closer to 0.<br />
\(\frac{2}{5}\) is closer to \(\frac{1}{2}\)<br />
4 + \(\frac{1}{2}\) = 4 \(\frac{1}{2}\)<br />

c. 24 \(\frac{2}{3}\) miles<br />
d. 25 \(\frac{7}{12}\) miles</p>
<p>Answer: 24 \(\frac{2}{3}\) miles</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Aaron is practicing for a triathlon.<br />
On Sunday, he bikes 12 \(\frac{5}{8}\) miles and swims 5 \(\frac{2}{3}\) miles.<br />
On Monday, he runs 6 \(\frac{3}{8}\) miles.<br />
5 \(\frac{2}{3}\) + 6 \(\frac{3}{8}\) = 12 \(\frac{1}{24}\)<br />
12 \(\frac{1}{24}\) + 12 \(\frac{5}{8}\) miles<br />
12 + \(\frac{1}{24}\) + 12 + \(\frac{5}{8}\)<br />
12 + 12 = 24<br />
\(\frac{1}{24}\) + \(\frac{5}{8}\) = \(\frac{1}{24}\) + \(\frac{15}{24}\) = \(\frac{16}{24}\) = \(\frac{2}{3}\)<br />
24 + \(\frac{2}{3}\) = 24 \(\frac{2}{3}\) mile<br />
The correct answer is option D.</p>

Which fraction represents the difference between the amounts of cake Mrs. Friedmon had before school and after school?<br />
Options:<br />
a. \(\frac{5}{8}\)<br />
b. 1 \(\frac{1}{2}\)<br />
c. 1 \(\frac{5}{8}\)<br />
d. 2 \(\frac{1}{2}\)</p>
<p>Answer: 1 \(\frac{5}{8}\)</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
The fraction for the above figure is 1 \(\frac{7}{8}\)<br />
The fraction for the second figure is \(\frac{1}{4}\)<br />
1 + \(\frac{7}{8}\) &#8211; \(\frac{1}{4}\)<br />
\(\frac{7}{8}\) &#8211; \(\frac{1}{4}\) = \(\frac{7}{8}\) &#8211; \(\frac{2}{8}\)<br />
\(\frac{7}{8}\) &#8211; \(\frac{2}{8}\) = \(\frac{5}{8}\)<br />
1 + \(\frac{5}{8}\) = 1 \(\frac{5}{8}\)<br />
The correct answer is option C.</p>
<p>Question 19.<br />
Cody is designing a pattern for a wood floor. The length of the pieces of wood are 1 \(\frac{1}{2}\) inches, 1 \(\frac{13}{16}\) inches, and 2 \(\frac{1}{8}\) inches. What is the length of the 5th piece of wood if the pattern continues?<br />
Options:<br />
a. 2 \(\frac{7}{6}\) inches<br />
b. 2 \(\frac{3}{4}\) inches<br />
c. 3 \(\frac{1}{2}\) inches<br />
d. 4 inches</p>
<p>Answer: 2 \(\frac{3}{4}\) inches</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
The length of the pieces of wood are 1 \(\frac{1}{2}\) inches, 1 \(\frac{13}{16}\) inches, and 2 \(\frac{1}{8}\) inches<br />
1 \(\frac{1}{2}\) = \(\frac{3}{2}\)<br />
1 \(\frac{13}{16}\) inches = \(\frac{29}{16}\)<br />
\(\frac{29}{16}\) &#8211; \(\frac{3}{2}\) = latex]\frac{5}{16}[/latex]<br />
5th piece = \(\frac{3}{2}\) + latex]\frac{5}{16}[/latex] (5 &#8211; 1)<br />
= \(\frac{3}{2}\) + latex]\frac{5}{16}[/latex] 4<br />
= \(\frac{3}{2}\) + latex]\frac{20}{16}[/latex]<br />
= \(\frac{3}{2}\) × latex]\frac{8}{8}[/latex] + latex]\frac{20}{16}[/latex]<br />
= latex]\frac{44}{16}[/latex] = 2 latex]\frac{3}{4}[/latex]<br />
Thus the correct answer is option B.</p>

<p>Answer: \(\frac{11}{12}\) hour</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Julie spends \(\frac{3}{4}\) hour studying on Monday and \(\frac{1}{6}\) hour studying on Tuesday.<br />
\(\frac{3}{4}\) + \(\frac{1}{6}\)<br />
LCD = 12<br />
\(\frac{9}{12}\) + \(\frac{2}{12}\) = \(\frac{11}{12}\) hour<br />
So, the correct answer is option D.</p>
