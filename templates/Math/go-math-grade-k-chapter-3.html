<p><strong>DIRECTIONS</strong><br />
Play with a partner. Place numeral cards as shown on the board. Shuffle the remaining cards and place them face down in a stack. Players take turns picking one card from the stack. They place the card to the right to form a number sequence without skipping any numbers. The number sequence can be forward from 0 or backward from 5. If a player picks a card that is not next in either number sequence, the card is returned to the bottom of the stack. The first player to complete a number sequence wins the game.<br />
<strong>MATERIALS</strong><br />
2 sets of numeral cards 0–5</p>

<p>Explanation :<br />
Number of Yellow counters are 4<br />
Number of Red counters are 4<br />
So, to make a sum of 6 we add two counters. That is represented in 4 different ways.<br />
1 red + 5 yellow, 2 red + 4 yellow, 3 red + 3 yellow, 5 red + 1 yellow all these expressions on adding gives the sum 6.</p>
<p><strong>DIRECTIONS</strong> <strong>2.</strong> Trace the number 6. Use two-color counters to model the different ways to make 6. Write to show some pairs of numbers that make 6.</p>

Explanation<br />
In the above image<br />
Given a model 8 object with 8 counters and later 1 more counter is added to the model 8.<br />
When you add 1 to 8 it becomes 9.<br />
The model 9 object is represented in the second table and the number 9 is represented below that.</p>
<p><strong>DIRECTIONS</strong> Model 8 objects. Show one more object. How many are there now? Tell a friend how you know. Draw the objects.</p>

Explanation:<br />
The ten frame is taken to make a model nine.<br />
To make the model nine i have used two sets of counters.<br />
set 1 have 5 rectangle counters<br />
set 2 have 4 triangle counters.<br />
ADDING these two gives the model 9.</p>
<p><strong>DIRECTIONS 1.</strong> Place counters as shown. Count and tell how many counters. Trace the number. <strong>2.</strong> How many more than 5 is 9? Write the number. <strong>3.</strong> Place counters in the ten frame to model nine. Tell a friend what you know about the number 9.</p>

Explanation:<br />
In the image i have taken triangles to make the model 9.<br />
first row with 4<br />
second row with 1<br />
third row with 4<br />
adding these three rows value = 4 + 1 + 4 = 9 give sum 9.</p>
<p><strong>DIRECTIONS 5.</strong> Mr. Lopez is making displays using sets of nine flags. Count the flags in each set. Which sets show nine flags? Circle those sets. <strong>6.</strong> Draw to show what you know about the number 9. Tell a friend about your drawing.</p>
<p><strong>HOME ACTIVITY</strong><br />
• Ask your child to show a set of eight objects. Have him or her show one more object and tell how many.</p>
