<p>Question 16.<br />
Mr. Parker jogs for 35 minutes each day. He jogs 5 days in week 1, 6 days in week 2, and 7 days in week 3. About how many minutes does he jog?<br />
about _____ minutes</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
about 630 minutes</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
From the given data,<br />
Mr. Parker jogs per day = 35 minutes<br />
He jogs 5 days in week 1 = 5 x 35 = 175 minutes<br />
6 days in week 2 = 6 x 35 = 210 minutes<br />
7 days in week 3 = 7 x 35 = 245 minutes<br />
Total minutes of jog by Mr. Parker = week 1 + week 2 + week 3<br />
= 175 + 210 + 245<br />
= 630 minutes<br />
So, total minutes of jog by Mr. Parker = 630 minutes</p>
<p>Question 17.<br />
There are 48 beads in a package. Candice bought 4 packages of blue, 9 packages of gold, 6 packages of red, and 2 packages of silver beads. About how many beads did Candice buy?<br />
about _____ beads</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
about 1008 beads</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
As per the given data,<br />
48 beads are there in a package<br />
Candice bought 4 packages of blue beads = 4 x 48 = 192<br />
9 packages of gold beads = 9 x 48 = 432<br />
6 packages of red beads = 6 x 48 = 288<br />
2 packages of silver beads = 2 x 48 = 96<br />
Total beads bought by Candice = 192 + 432 + 288 + 96<br />
= 1008 beads<br />
So, total beads bought by Candice = 1008.</p>

<p>Question 18.<br />
On average, a refrigerator door is opened 38 times each day. Len has two refrigerators in his house. Based on this average, about how many times in a 3-week period are the refrigerator doors opened?<br />
about _____ times</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
about 1600 times</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
From the given data,<br />
On average, a refrigerator door is opened per day = 38 times<br />
3-week period = 7 x 3 = 21<br />
Then, a refrigerator door is opened per 21 days = 21 x 38 = 798 times<br />
Len has 2 refrigerators in his house<br />
Then, two refrigerators door are opened per 21 days = 2 x 798<br />
= 1596 times<br />
So, in a 3 – week period refrigerator door is opened about 1600 times</p>

<p>Question 8.<br />
b. Look at Kim’s method. Can you think of another way Kim could use the model to find the product? Explain.<br />
<img src="https://i2.wp.com/gomathanswerkey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Go-Math-Grade-4-Answer-Key-Chapter-3-Multiply-2-Digit-Numbers-img-8.jpg?resize=198%2C161&#038;ssl=1" alt="Go Math Grade 4 Answer Key Chapter 3 Multiply 2-Digit Numbers img 8" width="198" height="161" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
Type below:<br />
__________</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
Other method: 12 x 15<br />
10 x 12 = 120<br />
5 x 12 = 60<br />
120 + 60 = 180.</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Kim follows another method to find 12 x 15<br />
That is, 100 + 50 = 150<br />
20 + 10 = 30<br />
Then, 150 + 30 =180<br />
12 x 15 = 180</p>
<p>Question 9.<br />
Look at the model in 8b. How would the partial products change if the product was 22 × 15? Explain why you think the products changed.<br />
Type below:<br />
__________</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
330</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Following the 8b method<br />
22 x 15 =330<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2759" src="https://i1.wp.com/gomathanswerkey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Chapter-3-Common-core-Image-6.jpg?resize=206%2C135&#038;ssl=1" alt="Chapter 3 - Common core - Image 6" width="206" height="135" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
200 + 100 = 300<br />
20 + 10 = 30<br />
Now, 300 + 30 = 330<br />
Finally, 22 x 15 = 330<br />
The factor of 15 is increased in present problem. So, the product also increases for 15 x 22.</p>

<p>Answer:<br />
14827 Cypress Street</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Given that tens digit is 5 less than 7 = 7 &#8211; 5 = 2. 2 is the tens digit.<br />
The thousands digit is twice the digit in the tens place = 2 x 2 = 4.<br />
The hundreds digit is the greatest even number that is less than 10 i.e, 8.<br />
The ones digit is the product of 7 and 1 = 7 x 1 = 7.<br />
The ten thousands digit is the difference between the hundreds digit and the ones digit. So, 8 &#8211; 7 = 1.<br />
Add the products to get the final answer = 14827.<br />

<p><strong>Mrs. Traynor’s class is taking a field trip to the zoo. The trip will cost $26 for each student. There are 22 students in her class.</strong></p>
<p>Question 2.<br />
Part A<br />
Round each factor to estimate the total cost of the students’ field trip.<br />
$ ______</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
$600</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Total cost of the students’ field trip = 22 x $26.<br />
22 x $26<br />
20 x $30 = $600<br />
The total cost would be about $600.</p>
<p>Question 2.<br />
Part B<br />
Use compatible numbers to estimate the total cost of the field trip.<br />
$ ______</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
$500</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
If we use compatible numbers to estimate the total cost of the field trip.<br />
22 x $26<br />
20 × 25 = 500<br />
The total cost would be about $500.</p>
<p>Question 2.<br />
Part C<br />
Which do you think is the better estimate? Explain.<br />
Better estimate: _________</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
Using rounded numbers is a better estimate. When rounded numbers are used, one estimated factor was $4 more than the actual factor and the other estimated factor was $2 that is less than the actual factor. So, the estimate should be close to the actual one. When compatible numbers are used both estimated factors were less than the actual factors. So, the product will be an underestimate.</p>

_____ pairs of sunglasses</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
3 pairs of sunglasses</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Given that Tanya has $42 to spend at the Dolphin Island store. T-shirts sell for $7 each and a pair of sunglasses sell for $6.<br />
Tanya buys 3 T-shirts = 3 x $7 = $21.<br />
pair of sunglasses = $42 &#8211; $21 = $21.<br />
1 pair of sunglasses sells for $6.<br />
So, $21 ÷ $7 = 3.<br />
3 pairs of sunglasses can Tanya buy with the amount of money she has left.</p>
