-&gt; Numbers to the right are greater than numbers to the left and numbers to the left are less than numbers to the right.<br />
Example: 2 &gt; -10<br />
2 is to the right of -10 on the number line.<br />
So, 2 is greater than -10.</p>

______ markers</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
8 markers</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Fiona starts at the beginning of a hiking trail and walks \(\frac{4}{5}\) mile. She counts the mileage markers that are placed every \(\frac{1}{10}\) mile along the trail.<br />

<p>Question 4.<br />
If Amanda hikes at an average speed of 2.72 miles per hour, how long will it take her to hike 6.8 miles?<br />
______ hours</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
2.5 hours</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
speed times time = distance<br />
distance = 6.8<br />
speed = 2.72<br />
time = s<br />
2.72 times s = 6.8<br />
divide both sides by 2.72<br />
s = 2.5<br />
The answer is 2.5 hours</p>
<p>Question 5.<br />
The area of a rectangle is 5 \(\frac{4}{5}\) square meters. The width of the rectangle is 2 \(\frac{1}{4}\) meter. Which is the best estimate for the length of the rectangle?<br />
______ meters</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
2 \(\frac{26}{45}\) meters</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Since the area of a rectangle is, A = l × b<br />
A = 5 \(\frac{4}{5}\) square meters<br />
b = 2 \(\frac{1}{4}\) meter<br />
5 \(\frac{4}{5}\) = l × 2 \(\frac{1}{4}\)<br />
l = \(\frac{29 × 4}{9 × 5}\) = \(\frac{116}{45}\) = 2 \(\frac{26}{45}\)</p>
<p>Question 6.<br />
Lillian bought 2.52 pounds of tomatoes and 1.26 pounds of lettuce to make a salad for 18 people. If each person got the same amount of salad, how much salad did each person get?<br />

<p>Answer:<br />
0.21 pounds per person</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Lillian bought 2.52 pounds of tomatoes and 1.26 pounds of lettuce to make a salad for 18 people.<br />
2.52 pounds + 1.26 pounds = 3.78 pounds of salad ÷ 18 people = 0.21 pounds of salad per person</p>

<p>Question 5.<br />
To pass a math test, students must correctly answer at least 0.6 of the questions. Donald’s score is \(\frac{5}{8}\), Karen’s score is 0.88, Gino’s score is \(\frac{3}{5}\) and Sierra’s score is \(\frac{4}{5}\). How many of the students passed the test?<br />
Type below:<br />
__________</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
4</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Donald&#8217;s score of 5/8 is equal to 0.625.<br />
Gino scored 3/5 which is 0.6.<br />
Sierra&#8217;s score of 4/5 equals 0.8.<br />
Karen&#8217;s score is already given, and 0.88 is greater than 0.6.<br />
None of the students obtained lower than 0.6.<br />
If at least does not include scores equal to 0.6, and only scores greater than 0.6, then Gino possibly failed this math test.<br />
If a passing score is equal to or greater than 0.6, then all four students passed the test.</p>

<p>Question 3.<br />
Simone bought 3.42 pounds of green apples and 2.19 pounds of red apples. She used 3 pounds to make a pie. How many pounds of apples are left?<br />
_____ pounds</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
2.61 pounds</p>

Trygg has \(\frac{3}{4}\) package of marigold seeds. He plants \(\frac{1}{6}\) of those seeds in his garden and divides the rest equally into 10 flowerpots. What fraction of a package of seeds is planted in each flowerpot?<br />
\(\frac{□}{□}\) package</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
\(\frac{1}{16}\) package</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
He has a 3/4 package and plants 1/6 of the seeds.<br />
3/4 × 1/6 = 1/8<br />
He divides the rest equally into 10 flowerpots.<br />
Subtract 1/8 from 3/4.<br />
The common denominator of 4 and 8 is 8.<br />
Multiply the numerator 3 × 2= 6 with a denominator of 8.<br />
3/4 &#8211; 1/8 = 6/8 -1/8 = 5/8<br />
5/8 is left to be divided equally into 10 flowerpots.<br />
5/8 ÷ 10/1<br />
= 5/8 * 1/10<br />
= 5/80<br />
= 1/16</p>

On Monday, Allie’s bank account balance was – $24. On Tuesday, her account balance was less than it was on Monday. Use absolute value to describe Allie’s balance on Tuesday as a debt.<br />
Type below:<br />
__________</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
On Tuesday, her account balance is less than -$24 means her debt will be bigger than $24 dollars.</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
On Monday, allies&#8217; bank account balance was -$24.<br />
Balance being negative means he is carrying a debt of $24.<br />
On Tuesday, Allie&#8217;s balance account was less than it was on Monday. It means<br />
Her bank account &lt; -$24<br />
So, she must be carrying a debit bigger than $24.<br />
Therefore, on Tuesday, her account balance being less than -$24 means her debt will be greater than $24 dollars.</p>

Dawn and Lin took off on skateboards from the same location but traveled in opposite directions. After 20 minutes, Dawn had traveled 6.42 kilometers and Lin had traveled 7.7 kilometers. How far apart were they?<br />
_____ kilometers</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
14.12 kilometers</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Distance of Dawn = 6.42 km<br />
Distance from Lin = 7.7 km in the opposite direction.<br />
If they went in opposite directions then they were moving away from each other.<br />
The final distance between the two, d = 6.42 + 7.7 = 14.12 km<br />
After 20 minutes Dawn and Lin were 14.12 km away.</p>
<p>Question 4.<br />
Rico and Josh took off on skateboards going in the same direction. After 20 minutes, Rico had traveled 5.98 kilometers and Josh had gone 8.2 kilometers. How far apart were they?<br />
_____ kilometers</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
2.22 kilometers</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Rico and Josh took off on skateboards going in the same direction.<br />
After 20 minutes, Rico had traveled 5.98 kilometers and Josh had gone 8.2 kilometers.<br />
D = 8.2 &#8211; 5.98 = 2.22 km<br />
Hence, Rico and Josh were 2.22 km apart from each other.</p>

1) Zach has 3/4 hour to play video games<br />
Convert to minutes<br />
1 hour = 60 minutes<br />
3/4 × 60 = 45 minutes<br />
2) It takes him an hour to set up the system<br />
Convert to minutes<br />
1/12 × 60 = 5 minutes<br />
3) 45 minutes &#8211; 5 minutes = 40 minutes<br />
4) Each round of his favorite game takes an hour<br />
Convert to minutes<br />
1/6 × 60 = 10 minutes<br />
5) Divide the time available to play video games by the time each round of his favorite game<br />
