<p>Question 17.<br />
Members of the Ozark Trail Hiking Club hiked a steep section of the trail in June and July. The table shows the distances club members hiked in miles. Write Maria’s July distance as a decimal.<br />
_____ miles</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
2.625 miles</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Maria&#8217;s July distance = 2 \(\frac{5}{8}\)<br />
Use division to rename the fraction part as a decimal.<br />
\(\frac{5}{8}\) = 0.625<br />
The quotient has 3 decimal places.<br />
Add the whole number to the decimal.<br />
2 + 0.625 = 2.625.<br />
2 \(\frac{5}{8}\) = 2.625</p>
<p>Question 18.<br />
How much farther did Zoey hike in June and July than Maria hiked in June and July? Explain how you found your answer.<br />
_____ miles</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
0.7 miles</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Maria: June = 2.95, July = 2 \(\frac{5}{8}\) = 2.58<br />
Zoey: June = 2.85, July = 3 \(\frac{3}{8}\) = 3.38<br />
[2.85 + 3.38] &#8211; [2.95 + 2.58] = 0.7 miles</p>
<p>Question 19.<br />
What’s the Error? Tabitha’s hiking distance in July was 2 \(\frac{1}{5}\) miles. She wrote the distance as 2.02 miles. What error did she make?<br />
Type below:<br />
__________</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
Tabitha’s hiking distance in July was 2 \(\frac{1}{5}\) miles.<br />
2 \(\frac{1}{5}\)<br />
Use division to rename the fraction part as a decimal.<br />
\(\frac{1}{5}\)  = 0.2<br />
The quotient has 1 decimal place.<br />
Add the whole number to the decimal.<br />
2 + 0.2 = 2.2.<br />
2 \(\frac{1}{5}\) = 2.2<br />
She wrote the distance as 2.02 miles in mistake.</p>
<p>Question 20.<br />
Use Patterns Write \(\frac{3}{8}, \frac{4}{8}, \text { and } \frac{5}{8}\) as decimals. What pattern do you see? Use the pattern to predict the decimal form of \(\frac{6}{8}\) and \(\frac{7}{8}\).<br />
Type below:<br />
__________</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
\(\frac{3}{8}, \frac{4}{8}, \text { and } \frac{5}{8}\) as decimals.<br />
0.375, 0.5, 0.625<br />
Each decimal is separated by 0.125.<br />
So, 6/8 = 0.625 + 0.125 = 0.75<br />
7/8 = 0.75 + 0.125 = 0.875</p>

<p>Question 4.<br />
At the factory, a baseball card is placed in every 9th package of cereal. A football card is placed in every 25th package of the cereal. What is the first package that gets both a baseball card and a football card?<br />
Type below:<br />
__________</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
225th package</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Look for the first number where both 25 and 9 are a factor of.<br />
25 x 1 = 25 which isn&#8217;t a factor of 9, so it won&#8217;t be 25.<br />
25 x 2 = 50, which isn&#8217;t a factor of 9.<br />
75 is not a factor of 9. (you know because you don&#8217;t get a whole number when you divide 75 into 9.)<br />
100 is not a factor of 9, nor is 125, 150, 175, or 200.<br />
However, 225 is a factor of both 25 and 9. This makes sense because 25 x 9 is 225.<br />
This means that the first package with both will be the 225th package.</p>

Type below:<br />
__________</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
Cara will use 1\(\frac{1}{8}\) cups of flour.</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
For first we will find how many cups of flours need to makes the original recipe. Cara uses 1 1/2 cups of flour for the muffins and 1/4 cup off flour for the topping.<br />
So, 1 1/2 + 1/4 cups of flour to make the original recipe.<br />
1 1/2 = 3/2<br />
3/2 + 1/4 = 7/4<br />
To make the original recipe Cara needs 7/4 cups of flour.<br />
If she makes \(\frac{1}{2}\) of the original recipe, then<br />
7/4 x 1/2 = 7/8 = 1 1/8<br />
Cara will use 1 1/8 cups of flour.</p>

<p>Question 15.<br />
The jogging track at Francine’s school is \(\frac{3}{4}\) mile long. Yesterday Francine completed two laps on the track. If she ran \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the distance and walked the remainder of the way, how far did she walk?<br />
____ mile</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
1 mile</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Length of jogging track at Francine’s school = 3/4 mile<br />
Let the distance covered by running be = x<br />
Let the distance covered by walking be = y<br />
Total number of laps completed by Francine = 2<br />
Total distance covered by Francine = number of laps X distance covered in one lap<br />
2 x 3/4 = 3/25 mile<br />
Now,<br />
distance covered by running = 1/3 of the total distance<br />
x = 1/3 x 3/2<br />
distance covered by walking y = total distance &#8211; distance covered by running<br />
3/2 &#8211; x = 3/2 &#8211; 1/2 = 1 mile<br />
Hence, Francine walked for 1 mile.</p>
<p>Question 16.<br />
At a snack store, \(\frac{7}{12}\) of the customers bought pretzels and \(\frac{3}{10}\) of those customers bought low-salt pretzels. Bill states that \(\frac{7}{30}\) of the customers bought low-salt pretzels. Does Bill’s statement make sense? Explain.<br />
Type below:<br />
__________</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
Bill&#8217;s statement does not make sense because it is incorrect:<br />
7/12 customers bought pretzels.<br />
3/10 Of those customers bought low salt pretzels (x)<br />
3/10 of 7/12 = x<br />
21/120 = x<br />
Simplify: 7/40<br />
To be correct, Bill would have to say that 7/40 of the customers bought low salt pretzels, but instead, he had said 7/30.</p>

Total weight of a box of popcorn =15/16 pounds.<br />
We are given two types of popcorns are there, butter popcorns and cheesy popcorns.<br />
Butter popcorn is the one-third of the total weight = 1/3 of the Total weight<br />
Plugging the value of the total weight, we get<br />
= 1/3 * 15/16 = 5/16 pounds.<br />
Cheesy popcorn = 2/3 of Total weight<br />
Plugging the value of total weight, we get<br />
= 2/3 * 15/16 = 10/16 or 5/8 pounds.<br />
Therefore, cheesy popcorn weighs is 5/8 pounds.</p>

<p>Question 17.<br />
Following the Baltimore Running Festival in 2009, volunteers collected and recycled 3.75 tons of trash. Graph 3.75 on a number line and write the weight as a mixed number.<br />
Type below:<br />
__________</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
Volunteers collected and recycled 3.75 tons of trash.<br />
We need to convert 3.75 as a mixed number.<br />
The mixed number consists of a whole number and a proper fraction.<br />
In the given number 3.75, 3 as the whole number and convert 0.75 to a fraction.<br />
3.75 = 3 + 0.75 = 3 + 75/100<br />
We can reduce the fraction 75/ 100 = 3+ 3/4 = 3 3/4</p>

<p>Answer:<br />
22/25 = 0.88<br />
17/20 = 0.85<br />
4/5 = 0.8<br />
3/4 = 0.75<br />
Monica had the highest score<br />
Let x be the total number of points:<br />

About _______ flags</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
About 8 flags</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Marion is making school flags. Each flag uses 2 \(\frac{3}{4}\) yards of felt. Marion has 24 \(\frac{1}{8}\) yards of felt.<br />
2 \(\frac{3}{4}\) = 11/4<br />
24 \(\frac{1}{8}\) = 193/8<br />
193/8 ÷ 11/4<br />
193/8 x 4/11 = 8.77<br />
About 8 flags</p>
<p>Question 14.<br />
A garden snail travels about 2 \(\frac{3}{5}\) feet in 1 minute. At that speed, about how many hours would it take the snail to travel 350 feet?<br />
About _______ hours</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
About 2 hours</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
2 \(\frac{3}{5}\) = 2.6<br />
That&#8217;s how long he travels in one minute. There are 60 minutes in an hour so multiply it by 60 and see if that gets you close to 350.<br />
60 x 2.6 = 156<br />
Now let&#8217;s add one more hour.<br />
156 + 156 = 312<br />
14 x 2.6 = 36.4<br />
312 + 36.4 = 348.4<br />
348.4 + 2.6 = 351<br />
So two hours and fourteen minutes</p>

<p><strong>What’s the Error?</strong></p>
<p>Question 15.<br />
Megan is making pennants from a piece of butcher paper that is 10 \(\frac{3}{8}\) yards long. Each pennant requires \(\frac{3}{8}\) yard of paper. To estimate the number of pennants she could make, Megan estimated the quotient 10 \(\frac{3}{8}\) ÷ \(\frac{3}{8}\).<br />
Look at how Megan solved the problem. Find her error<br />
Estimate:<br />
10 \(\frac{3}{8}\) ÷ \(\frac{3}{8}\)<br />
10 ÷ \(\frac{1}{2}\) = 5<br />
Correct the error. Estimate the quotient.<br />
So, Megan can make about _____ pennants.<br />
Describe the error that Megan made<br />
Explain Tell which compatible numbers you used to estimate 10 \(\frac{3}{8}\) ÷ \(\frac{3}{8}\). Explain why you chose those numbers.<br />
Type below:<br />
__________</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
10 \(\frac{3}{8}\) ÷ \(\frac{3}{8}\)<br />
10 \(\frac{3}{8}\) = 83/8 = 10.375<br />
\(\frac{3}{8}\) = 0.375<br />

<p>Question 12.<br />
How is estimating quotients different from estimating products?<br />
Type below:<br />
__________</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
To estimate products and quotients, you need to first round the numbers. To round to the nearest whole number, look at the digit in the tenths place. If it is less than 5, round down. If it is 5 or greater, round up. Remember that an estimate is an answer that is not exact, but is approximate and reasonable.<br />
Let’s look at an example of estimating a product.<br />
Estimate the product: 11.256×6.81<br />
First, round the first number. Since there is a 2 in the tenths place, 11.256 rounds down to 11.<br />
Next, round the second number. Since there is an 8 in the tenths place, 6.81 rounds up to 7.<br />
Then, multiply the rounded numbers. 11×7=77<br />
The answer is 77.<br />
Let’s look at an example of estimating a quotient.<br />
Estimate the quotient: 91.93÷4.39<br />
First, round the first number. Since there is a 9 in the tenths place, 91.93 rounds up to 92.<br />
Next, round the second number. Since there is a 3 in the tenths place, 4.39 rounds down to 4.<br />
Then, divide the rounded numbers.<br />
92÷4=23<br />
The answer is 23.</p>

16 kits are in the box</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Eliza opens a box of bead kits. The box weighs 2 \(\frac{2}{3}\) lb. Each bead kit weighs \(\frac{1}{6}\) lb, 2 \(\frac{2}{3}\) ÷ \(\frac{1}{6}\) = 8/3 ÷ 1/6 = 16.<br />
16 kits are in the box</p>
<p>Question 9.<br />
Hassan has two boxes of trail mix. Each box holds 1 \(\frac{2}{3}\) lb of trail mix. He eats \(\frac{1}{3}\) lb of trail mix each day. How many days can Hassan eat trail mix before he runs out?<br />
_____ days</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
10 days</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Hassan has two boxes of trail mix. Each box holds 1 \(\frac{2}{3}\) lb of trail mix.<br />
1 \(\frac{2}{3}\) = 5/3<br />
2 x (5/3) = 10/3<br />
He eats \(\frac{1}{3}\) lb of trail mix each day.<br />
10/3 ÷ 1/3 = 10<br />
Hassan eats trail mix for 10 days before he runs out.</p>
