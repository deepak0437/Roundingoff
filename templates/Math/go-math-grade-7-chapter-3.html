          All these ratios are terminating decimals as all numerators divided by 10 lead to a terminating decimal.</p>
          <p>Question 25.<br />
          Yvonne bought 4 \(\frac{7}{8}\) yards of material to make a dress.<br />
          a. What is 4 \(\frac{7}{8}\) written as an improper fraction?<br />
          \(\frac{โก}{โก}\)</p>
          <p>Answer:<br />
          To convert fraction decimals, we have to divide the numerator to the denominator. If the quotient goes on and on, then it is a repeating decimal, and to write this as a decimal, put a bar on top of the repeating digits.<br />
          Convert from mixed fraction to the improper fraction.<br />
          4 \(\frac{7}{8}\) = (8 ร 4) + 7 = 32 + 7 = 39/8</p>
          <p>Question 25.<br />

          ______</p>
          <p>Answer:<br />
          Remember that we need to add the whole number and just convert the fraction part to decimal.<br />
          7/8 = 0.875<br />
          The fraction is a terminating decimal. Combining the whole number and the decimal part we get,<br />
          4 + 0.875 = 4.875</p>
          <p>Question 25.<br />
          c. Communicate Mathematical Ideas If Yvonne wanted to make 3 dresses that use 4 \(\frac{7}{8}\) yd of fabric each, explain how she could use estimation to make sure she has enough fabric for all of them.<br />

          <p>Question 27.<br />
          Problem Solving Marcus is 5 \(\frac{7}{24}\) feet tall. Ben is 5 \(\frac{5}{16}\) feet tall. Which of the two boys is taller? Justify your answer.<br />
          _____________</p>
          <p>Answer:<br />
          Explanation:<br />
          To convert fraction decimals, we have to divide the numerator to the denominator. If the quotient goes on and on, then it is a repeating decimal, and to write this as a decimal, put a bar on top of the repeating digits.<br />
          To determine who is taller, we convert both to decimals. Remember that we need to add the whole number and just convert the fraction part to decimal.<br />
          For Marcus:<br />
          7/24 = 0.29166..<br />
          Combine the whole number and the decimal part we get 5.29166..<br />
          For Ben:<br />
          5/16 = 0.3125<br />
          Combine the whole number and the decimal part we get 5.1325<br />
          Hence Ben is taller.</p>
          <p>Question 28.<br />
          Represent Real-World Problems If one store is selling \(\frac{3}{4}\) of a bushel of apples for 9 dollars, and another store is selling \(\frac{2}{3}\) of a bushel of apples for 9 dollars, which store has the better deal? Explain your answer.<br />
          _____________</p>
          <p>Answer:<br />
          To convert fraction decimals, we have to divide the numerator to the denominator. If the quotient goes on and on, then it is a repeating decimal, and to write this as a decimal, put a bar on top of the repeating digits.<br />
          To determine which store has a better deal, we convert both fractions to decimals.<br />
          For the first store:<br />
          3/4 = 0.75<br />
          For the second store:<br />
          2/3 = 0.666..<br />
          Since the first store offers 0.75 of a bushel of apples, this store has a better deal.</p>
          <p>Question 29.<br />
          Analyze Relationships You are given a fraction in simplest form. The numerator is not zero. When you write the fraction as a decimal, it is a repeating decimal. Which numbers from 1 to 10 could be the denominator?<br />
          Type below:<br />
          _____________</p>
          <p>Answer: {3, 6, 7, 9}</p>
          <p>Explanation:<br />
          Since the only numbers which can be factors of the denominators lead to a terminating decimal are 1, 2, and 5 and combinations of them, it means that if the denominator has at least one of the other numbers at the denominator, the decimal form will be a repeating decimal.<br />
          Among the numbers from 1 to 10, the presence of any of these numbers in the denominator will lead to a repeating decimal:<br />
          {3, 6, 7, 9}</p>
          <p>Question 30.<br />
          Communicate Mathematical Ideas Julie got 21 of the 23 questions on her math test correct. She got 29 of the 32 questions on her science test correct. On which test did she get a higher score? Can you compare the fractions \(\frac{21}{23}\) and \(\frac{29}{32}\) by comparing 29 and 21? Explain. How can Julie compare her scores?<br />
          _____________</p>
          <p>Answer:<br />
          To convert fraction decimals, we have to divide the numerator to the denominator. If the quotient goes on and on, then it is a repeating decimal, and to write this as a decimal, put a bar on top of the repeating digits.<br />
          For the math test:<br />
          21/23 = 0.9130<br />
          For the science test:<br />
          29/32 = 0.9063<br />
          Therefore she got a higher score in her math test.<br />
          Julie got a higher score in her math test. We cannot compare the fractions by comparing the numerators. Instead, we can compare her scores if the denominators of the fractions are the same.</p>

          How can you use a number line to find the sum of -4 and 6?<br />
          Type below:<br />
          ____________</p>
          <p>Answer: 6</p>
          <p>Explanation:<br />
          Remember if the number being added is positive, move the number of units going to the right and if the number being added is negative, move the number of units to the left.<br />
          Since we are adding a positive number, starting from -4 we move 6 units to the right. This results in 2.</p>

          _______</p>
          <p>Answer: $12.75</p>
          <p>Explanation:<br />
          We use positive numbers for the money she earns and negative numbers for the money she spends.<br />
          -2.25 + 15 = 12.75<br />
          Thus her profit is $12.75</p>
          <p>Question 20.<br />
          A submarine submerged at a depth of -35.25 meters dives an additional 8.5 meters. What is the new depth of the submarine?<br />
          _______</p>
          <p>Answer: In adding two integers with same sign add their absolute value and keep the common sign.<br />
          When adding two integers with opposite sign subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger and keep the sign of the number with the larger absolute value.<br />
          Since the submarine dove 32.25 meters down this can be interrupted as -32.25. And because it dove an additional 8.5 meters down, we can add -8.5 meters to the previous distance.<br />
          Add 32.25 and 8.5 meters<br />
          32.25 + 8.5 = 43.75 meters<br />
          Thus the submarines new depth is 43.75 meters deep or -43.75 meters.</p>

          Renee hiked for 4 \(\frac{3}{4}\) miles. After resting, Renee hiked back along the same route for 3 \(\frac{1}{4}\) miles.<br />
          4 \(\frac{3}{4}\) + (-3 \(\frac{1}{4}\)) = 1 \(\frac{1}{2}\)<br />
          Thus Renee needs to hike to return to the place where she started is 1 \(\frac{1}{2}\) or 1.5 miles.</p>
          <p>Question 22.<br />
          Geography<br />
          The average elevation of the city of New Orleans, Louisiana, is 0.5 m below sea level. The highest point in Louisiana is Driskill Mountain at about 163.5 m higher than New Orleans. How high is Driskill Mountain?<br />
          _______</p>
          <p>Answer: 163 meters</p>
          <p>Explanation:<br />
          We use the positive numbers for the elevation above the sea level and negative numbers for the elevation below the sea level.<br />
          163.5 &#8211; 0.5 = 163 meters<br />
          Thus the height of the Driskill mountain is 163 meters.</p>

          If the bakery started with an extra $250 from the profits in December, describe how to use the information in the table to figure out the profit or loss of money at the bakery by the end of August. Then calculate the profit or loss.<br />
          Balance: $ _______</p>
          <p>Answer: 948.71</p>
          <p>Explanation:<br />
          If the bakery started with an extra $250 from the profits in December.<br />
          We will add this amount to January&#8217;s income.<br />
          250 + 1205 + 1183 + 1664 + 2413 + 2260 + 2183 = 11,158<br />
          We compute the expenses during the 6 months<br />
          (-1290) + (-1345.44) + (-1664) + (-2106.24) + (-1958.50) + (-1845.12) = -10209.29<br />

          <p>Answer: -20.1ยฐC</p>
          <p>Explanation:<br />
          Remember if the number being subtracted is positive, move the number of units going to the left and if the number being subtracted is negative, move the number of units to the right.<br />
          Since the temperature of the substance is -12.6 and it decreases further by 7.5, we can create the expression -12.6 &#8211; 7.5.<br />
          -12.6 &#8211; 7.5 = -20.1<br />
          Thus the final temperature is -20.1ยฐC</p>

          A diver went 25.65 feet below the surface of the ocean, and then 16.5 feet further down, he then rose 12.45 feet. Write and solve an expression to find the diverโs new depth.<br />
          _______</p>
          <p>Answer: -29.7 feet</p>
          <p>Explanation:<br />
          Remember if the number being subtracted is positive, move the number of units going to the left and if the number being subtracted is negative, move the number of units to the right.<br />
          Since the diver went down 25.65 feet then dove again further by 16.5 feet then rose up by 12.45 feet, we can create the expression -25.65 &#8211; 16.5 + 12.45 = -29.7 feet<br />
          The diver&#8217;s new depth is -29.7 feet.</p>

          For Home Economics class, Sandra has 5 cups of flour. She made 3 batches of cookies that each used 1.5 cups of flour. Write and solve an expression to find the amount of flour Sandra has left after making the 3 batches of cookies.<br />
          _______ cups</p>
          <p>Answer: 0.5 cups</p>
          <p>Explanation:<br />
          Sandra has a total of 5 cups of flour. Since she used 1.5 cups per batch of the cookie, and there are 3 batches, we can subtract the product of the cups and the number of batches<br />
          1.5 ร 3 = 4.5<br />
          Therefore the expression should be 5 &#8211; 4.5 = 0.5<br />
          Thus Sandra has 0.5 cups of flour left.</p>

          In class, Matthew stated,โI think that a negative is like the opposite. That is why multiplying a negative times a negative equals a positive. The opposite of negative is positive, so it is just like multiplying the opposite of a negative twice, which is two positives.โ<br />
          Do you agree or disagree with his reasoning? What would you say in response to him?<br />
          _______</p>

          Represent Real-World Problems<br />
          The ground temperature at Brigham Airport is 12 ยฐC. The temperature decreases by 6.8 ยฐC for every increase of 1 kilometer above the ground. What is the overall change in temperature outside a plane flying at an altitude of 5 kilometers above Brigham Airport?<br />
          _______ ยฐC</p>
          <p>Answer: -22ยฐC</p>
          <p>Explanation:<br />
          Remember if the number being multiplied is positive, starting from zero moves the number of units by how many times it is multiplied going to the right and if the number being multiplied is negative, starting from zero, move the number of units by how many times it is multiplied going to the left.<br />
          Note that the ground temperature is 12ยฐC. Since the temperature decreases by 6.8ยฐC for every kilometer above ground, and the given height of the plane is 5 kilometers,<br />
          We can subtract the product of the temperature and the distance 5(6.8) from the ground temperature.<br />
          Therefore the expression should be 12 &#8211; 5(6.8)<br />
          = 12 &#8211; 34<br />
          = -22<br />

          Find two integers whose sum is -7 and whose product is 12. Explain how you found the numbers.<br />
          Type below:<br />
          _____________</p>
          <p>Answer: -3 and -4</p>
          <p>Explanation:<br />
          Let x and y be the two numbers. Write the equations using the given information<br />
          x + y = -7<br />
          xy = 12<br />
          Since the two numbers multiply to a positive and add to a negative the two numbers must be negative. Find the pairs of negative numbers that multiply to 12.<br />
          -1 and -12, -2 and -6 and -3 and -4.<br />
          Thus the pairs that have a sum as -7 and product as 12 is -3 and -4.</p>

          <p>Explanation:<br />
          The price of one share of ABC Company declined a total of $45.75 in 5 days.<br />
          We use negative numbers for the price going down.<br />
          The average change in the price of one share per day is the quotient.<br />
          -45.75/5<br />
          We determine the sign of the quotient.<br />
          The quotient will be negative because the numbers have different signs.<br />
          -45.75/5 = -9.15<br />

          <p>Question 12.<br />
          Explain how you would find the sign of the quotient \(\frac{32 \div(-2)}{-16 \div 4}\).<br />
          Type below:<br />
          ___________</p>
          <p>Answer: positive</p>
          <p>Explanation:<br />
          Given,<br />
          \(\frac{32 \div(-2)}{-16 \div 4}\)<br />
          Since all the operations are of multiplication and division, the sign is given by the number of negative signs.<br />
          If the number of negative signs is even, the quotient is positive while if the number of negative signs is odd, the quotient is negative.<br />
          In this case, the number of negative signs is 2, therefore even, so the quotient is positive.<br />
          \(\frac{32 \div(-2)}{-16 \div 4}\) = -16/-4 = 4<br />
          Thus the solution is positive.</p>

          A seafood restaurant claims an increase of $1,750.00 over its average profit during a week where it introduced a special of baked clams.<br />
          a. If this is true, how much extra profit did it receive per day?<br />
          $ _______ per day</p>
          <p>Answer:<br />
          There are 7 days in a week so divide the total profit of $1750 by 7 to find the extra profit per day.<br />
          1750/7 = 250<br />

          <p>Answer:<br />
          Since the company lost $490, its income changed by -$490.<br />
          Divide the change in income by 7 to find the average daily change.<br />
          -$490/7 = -$70<br />
          Thus the average daily change is -$70 per day.</p>

          ________ \(\frac{โก}{โก}\)</p>
          <p>Answer: 29 \(\frac{1}{8}\)</p>
          <p>Explanation:<br />
          The American football field is 100 yds long, 53 1/3 yards wide, and has 10-yard touchdown zones at each end of the field.<br />
          Let x = distance of the referee at the end of the quarter from the nearest goal.<br />
          The distance between the same yard lines on either side of the centerline is<br />
          100 &#8211; 2x<br />
          This distance is the 41 3/4 yards that the referee walked. Therefore<br />
          100 &#8211; 2x = 41.75<br />
          -2x = 41.75 &#8211; 100 = -58.25<br />
          x = 29.125 yd<br />
          Convert from decimal to fraction.<br />
          x = 29 \(\frac{1}{8}\) yards</p>
          <p><strong>In 8โ10, a teacher gave a test with 50 questions, each worth the same number of points. Donovan got 39 out of 50 questions right. Marciโs score was 10 percentage points higher than Donovanโs.</strong></p>
          <p>Question 8.<br />
          What was Marciโs score? Explain.<br />
          ________ %</p>
          <p>Answer: 88 %</p>
          <p>Explanation:<br />
          39/50 = 78/100<br />
          78/100 + 10/100 = 88/100 = 44/50<br />
          88/100 = 88%</p>
          <p>Question 9.<br />
          How many more questions did Marci answer correctly? Explain.<br />
          ________ questions</p>
          <p>Answer: 5 questions</p>
          <p>Explanation:<br />
          Marci got 44 correct and Donovan got 39 correct so she got 44 &#8211; 39 = 5 more questions correct.</p>
          <p>Question 10.<br />
          Explain how you can check your answers for reasonableness.<br />
          Type below:<br />
          _____________</p>
          <p>Answer:<br />
          You can check your answers for reasonableness by using estimates.<br />
          Donovan scored 39/50 which is about 40/50 = 80/100 = 80%<br />
          Ten percentage points higher is then 80% + 10% = 90% = 90/100 = 45/50.<br />
          Since Marci&#8217;s score was 44/50, it is a reasonable answer.</p>

          <p>Answer: -9 ยฐF</p>
          <p>Explanation:<br />
          Given that,<br />
          On Sunday, the wind chill temperature reached -36 ยฐF.<br />
          On Monday, the wind chill temperature only reached \(\frac{1}{4}\) of Sundayโs wind chill temperature.<br />
          -36 ร \(\frac{1}{4}\) = -9ยฐF<br />
          Thus the correct answer is option A.</p>
          <p>Question 7.<br />
          The level of a lake was 8 inches below normal. It decreased 1 \(\frac{1}{4}\) inches in June and 2 \(\frac{3}{8}\) inches more in July. What was the new level with respect to the normal level?<br />
          Options:<br />
          a. -11 \(\frac{5}{8}\) in.<br />
          b. -10 \(\frac{5}{8}\) in.<br />
          c. -9 \(\frac{1}{8}\) in.<br />
          d. -5 \(\frac{3}{8}\) in.</p>
          <p>Answer: -11 \(\frac{5}{8}\) in.</p>
          <p>Explanation:<br />
          The level of a lake was 8 inches below normal. It decreased 1 \(\frac{1}{4}\) inches in June and 2 \(\frac{3}{8}\) inches more in July.<br />
          The initial level is below normal so it is represented by a negative number. The level continued to decrease in June and July so those changes are also represented by negative numbers.<br />
          Find the sum of these values to find what the new level was with respect to the normal level.<br />
          -8 &#8211; 1 \(\frac{1}{4}\) &#8211; 2 \(\frac{3}{8}\)<br />
          = -8 &#8211; \(\frac{5}{4}\) &#8211; \(\frac{19}{8}\)<br />
          = &#8211; \(\frac{93}{8}\)<br />
          = &#8211; 11 \(\frac{5}{8}\)<br />
          Thus the correct answer is option A.</p>

          <p>Question 8.<br />
          The average annual rainfall for a town is 43.2 inches.<br />
          a. What is the average monthly rainfall?<br />
          ________</p>
          <p>Answer:<br />
          If the average rainfall us 43.2 inches then the monthly rainfall is 43.2/12 = 3.6 inches since there are 12 months in a year.</p>
          <p>Question 8.<br />
          <img src="https://i0.wp.com/gomathanswerkey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Go-Math-Grade-7-Answer-Key-Chapter-3-Rational-Numbers-img-7.jpg?resize=295%2C99&#038;ssl=1" alt="Go Math Grade 7 Answer Key Chapter 3 Rational Numbers MODULE 3 MIXED REVIEW img 7" width="295" height="99" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
          b. The difference of a given monthโs rainfall from the average monthly rainfall is called the deviation. What is the deviation for each month shown?<br />
          May: ___________ inch<br />
          June: ___________ inches<br />
          July: ___________ inches</p>
          <p>Answer:<br />
          The deviation for May is 2 3/5 &#8211; 3.6 = 2.6 &#8211; 3.6 = -1 inches.<br />
          The deviation for June is 7/8 &#8211; 3.6 = -2.725 inches.<br />
          The deviation for July 4 1/4 &#8211; 3.6 = 0.65 inches.</p>
          <p>Question 8.<br />
          c. The average monthly rainfall for the previous 9 months was 4 inches. Did the town exceed its average annual rainfall? If so, by how much?<br />
          ________</p>
          <p>Answer:<br />
          If is rained 4 inches for 9 months, the total amount of rain over the 12 month period is than 9(4) + 2 3/5 + 7/8 + 4 1/4<br />
          = 36 + 2.6 + 0.875 + 4.25 = 43.725.<br />
          Since this is greater than the average annual rainfall of 43.2, the town did exceed is average annual rainfall.<br />
          the difference of 43.725 and 43.2 is<br />
          43.725 &#8211; 43.2 = 0.525<br />
          so, it exceeded it by 0.525 inches.</p>

          <p><strong>Write each mixed number as a whole number or decimal. Classify each number according to the group(s) to which it belongs: rational numbers, integers, or whole numbers.</strong></p>
          <p>Question 1.<br />
          \(\frac{3}{4}\)<br />
          ________</p>
          <p>Answer: 0.75, rational</p>
          <p>Explanation:<br />
          Write as a decimal by dividing 3 by 4. A shortcut with fourths is to think of the fractions in terms of money. 4 quarters make a dollar and 3 quarters is $0.75 so three-fourths is 0.75 in decimal form.<br />
          Since \(\frac{3}{4}\) could not be written as a whole number or integer, it is a rational number.</p>
          <p>Question 2.<br />
          \(\frac{8}{2}\)<br />
          ________</p>
          <p>Answer: 4</p>
          <p>Explanation:<br />
          \(\frac{8}{2}\) = 4<br />
          Since 4 doesn&#8217;t have a decimal and is positive, it is a whole number. All whole numbers are also integers and rational numbers so 4 is a rational number, integer, and a whole number.</p>
          <p>Question 3.<br />
          \(\frac{11}{3}\)<br />
          ________</p>
          <p>Answer: 3.66</p>
          <p>Explanation:<br />
          Rewrite as a mixed number and then divide 2 by 3 to get the decimal part of the number.<br />
          \(\frac{11}{3}\) = 3 2/3 = 3.666&#8230;<br />
          Since 3.66.. has a decimal, it is not an integer or whole number. Therefore it is a rational number only.</p>
          <p>Question 4.<br />
          \(\frac{5}{2}\)<br />
          ________</p>
          <p>Answer: 2.5</p>
          <p>Explanation:<br />
          Write as a mixed number and then divide 1 by 2 to get the decimal part of the number a shortcut is to think of the fraction in terms of money. Half a dollar is $0.50 so one half equals 0.50 = 0.50<br />
          Since 2.5 has a decimal, it is not an integer or whole number. Therefore 2.5 is a rational number only.</p>

          <p>Answer:<br />
          Write as decimal by dividing 1 by 2 and dividing 1 by 4 a shortcut is to think about ur in terms of money. Half of a dollae is $0.50 and a quarter is $0.25<br />
          So 1/2 = 0.50 = 0.5<br />
          1/4 = 0.25<br />
          6 1/2 = 6.5 and 1 1/4 = 1.25</p>
          <p>Question 1.<br />

          __________</p>
          <p>Answer:<br />
          The library is closer to City Hall than the post office is so d is the difference between the distance from City Hall to the Post Office and the distance between City Hall and the Library Site.<br />
          d = 6 1/2 &#8211; 1 1/4</p>
          <p>Question 1.<br />
          c. Write an equation that represents the following statement: The distance from City Hall to the library site plus the distance from the library site to the post office is equal to the distance from City Hall to the post office.<br />
          Type below:<br />
          __________</p>
          <p>Answer:<br />
          The distance from the City Hall to the library is d, the distance from the library to the post office is 1 1/4 since the library is 1 1/4 miles closer to City Hall than the post office is, the distance from City Hall to the Post Office is 6 1/4<br />
          d + 1 1/4 = 6 1/4</p>
          <p>Question 1.<br />
          d. Solve your equation from part c to determine the distance from City Hall to the library site, and the distance from the post office to the library site.<br />
          City Hall to library site: __________ miles<br />
          Library site to post office: __________ miles</p>
          <p>Answer:<br />
          d = 6 1/2 &#8211; 1 1/4<br />
          d = 6 2/4 &#8211; 1 1/4<br />
          d = 5 1/4<br />
          Thus the distance is 5 1/4 miles.</p>

          a. Sumaya writes the equation 378 = -20d to find the number of days she will need to finish the book. Identify the errors that Sumaya made.<br />
          Type below:<br />
          __________</p>
          <p>Answer:<br />
          She made the mistake of using -20 in the equation instead of a positive 20. The negative can&#8217;t be used since she is not reading a negative number of pages per day.<br />
          She also made the mistake of adding 90 to 288 instead of subtracting.<br />
          Since she has already read 90 pages she has less than 288 pages left to read, not more.<br />
          288 &#8211; 90 = 198<br />
          The correct equation is 198 = 20d</p>
          <p>Question 2.<br />
          b. Write and solve an equation to determine how many days Sumaya will need to finish the book. In your answer, count part of a day as a full day. Show that your answer is reasonable.<br />
          ______ days</p>
          <p>Answer:</p>
          <p>198 = 20d is dividing both sides by 20 gives d = 198/20 = 9.9<br />
          Rounding this up gives 10 days.<br />
          This answer is reasonable since the books is about 300 pages and she has read about 100 pages of the book leaving about 200 pages left to read.<br />
          She is reading 20 pages per day and 20 ร 10 = 200<br />
          So it would take 10 days to read about 200 pages.</p>
          <p>Question 2.<br />
          c. Estimate how many days you would need to read a book about the same length as Sumayaโs book. What information did you use to find the estimate?<br />
          Type below:<br />
          __________</p>
          <p>Answer:<br />
          Sumaya&#8217;s book is about 300 pages. Reading 20 pages a day would mean it would take about 300/20 = 15 days to read the book.</p>

          Juanita is watering her lawn using the water stored in her rainwater tank. The water level in the tank drops \(\frac{1}{3}\) inch every 10 minutes she waters.<br />
          a. What is the change in the tankโs water level after 1 hour?<br />
          ______ inches</p>
          <p>Answer: -2 inches</p>
          <p>Explanation:<br />
          Juanita is watering her lawn using the water stored in her rainwater tank.<br />
          There are six 10 minute intervals in 1 hour so change is<br />
          6 ร &#8211;\(\frac{1}{3}\) = -2 inches<br />
          Therefore, the tank&#8217;s water level after 1 hour is -2 inches.</p>
          <p>Question 14.<br />
          b. What is the expected change in the tankโs water level after 2.25 hours?<br />
          ______ inches</p>
          <p>Answer: -4.5 inches</p>
          <p>Explanation:<br />
          Since the water level drops 2 inches every hour, in 2.25 hours the water level change will be -2 ร 2.25 = -4.5 inches<br />
          Thus the expected change in the tankโs water level after 2.25 hours is -4.5 inches.</p>
          <p>Question 14.<br />
          c. If the tankโs water level is 4 feet, how many days can Juanita water if she waters for 15 minutes each day?<br />
          ______ days</p>
          <p>Answer: 96 days</p>
          <p>Explanation:<br />
          15 minutes is 1/4 of an hour so in 15 minutes the water level will have dropped by 2 ร 1/4 = 1/2 inches.<br />
          Since the water level is initially 4 feet = 48 inches<br />
          She can water for 48/1/2 = 48 ร 2 = 96 days<br />
          It takes 96 days if she waters for 15 minutes.</p>
