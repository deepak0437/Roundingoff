Explain how you solved the problem.<br />
_____ stamps</p>
<p>Answer: 33 stamps</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />

Out of their collections, \(\frac{3}{10}\) of Zack’s stamps, \(\frac{5}{6}\) of Teri’s stamps, and \(\frac{3}{8}\) of Paco’s stamps were from foreign countries.<br />
Number of stamps Zack collected = 30<br />
Number of stamps Teri collected = 18<br />
Number of stamps Paco collected = 24<br />
\(\frac{3}{10}\) of 30<br />
\(\frac{3}{10}\) × 30 = 3 × 3 = 9<br />
\(\frac{5}{6}\) × 18 = 5 × 3 = 15<br />
\(\frac{3}{8}\) × 24 = 3 × 3 = 9<br />

A). If she wants to double the recipe, how much flour will she need?<br />
_____ \(\frac{□}{□}\) cups flour</p>
<p>Answer: 5 \(\frac{1}{2}\) cups flour</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
To bake the sugar cookies she needs 2 \(\frac{3}{4}\) cups flour.<br />
If she wants to double the recipe, she needs to multiply the 2 \(\frac{3}{4}\) cups flour by 2.<br />
2 \(\frac{3}{4}\) + 2 \(\frac{3}{4}\) = 5 \(\frac{1}{2}\) cups flour</p>
<p>Question 20.<br />
B). Baxter wants to make 1 \(\frac{1}{2}\) times the recipe. Will he need more or less sugar than Violet needs if she doubles the recipe? Explain.<br />
__________ sugar</p>
<p>Answer: less</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
If violet doubles the recipe he need 2 × 1 \(\frac{1}{2}\) = 3 cups of sugar<br />
Baxter wants to make 1 \(\frac{1}{2}\) times the recipe.<br />
1 \(\frac{1}{2}\) × \(\frac{1}{2}\) = 1 \(\frac{3}{4}\)<br />

<p>Question 20.<br />
C). As shown, the recipe makes 60 cookies. Jorge wants to bring 150 cookies. How much flour will he need to make 150 cookies? Explain how you got your answer. (Hint: what can you multiply 60 by to get 150?)<br />
_____ \(\frac{□}{□}\) cups flour</p>
<p>Answer: 2 \(\frac{1}{2}\) cups flour</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
The recipe makes 60 cookies. Jorge wants to bring 150 cookies.<br />
Let the amount of flour be x.<br />
60 × x = 150<br />
x = 150/60 = 5/2<br />
The mixed fraction of \(\frac{5}{2}\) is 2 \(\frac{1}{2}\)<br />
Thus, Jorge need 2 \(\frac{1}{2}\) cups flour to make 150 cookies.</p>
