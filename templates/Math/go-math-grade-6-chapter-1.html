Katie is making hair clips to sell at the craft fair. To make each hair clip, she uses 1 barrette and 1 precut ribbon. The barrettes are sold in packs of 12, and the precut ribbons are sold in packs of 9. How many packs of each item does she need to buy to make the least number of hair clips with no supplies left over?<br />
a. What information are you given?</p>
<p>Answer: 3 packs of barrettes and 4 packs of precut ribbons.</p>
<p>Explanation: As barrettes are sold in packs of 12 and precut ribbons are sold in packs of 9, so we need to find the number of packs of each item does she need to make the least number of hair clips with no supplies left over. So the LCM of 12 and 9.<br />
Multiples of 12 are: 12,24,36<br />
Multiples of 9 are: 9,18,27,36<br />

<p>Answer: 108</p>
<p>Explanation: As Reptile stickers come in sheets of 6 and fish stickers come in sheets of 9, so we will find the LCM of 6 and 9 to get the least number of sheets,<br />
Multiples of 6 are 6,12,18<br />
Multiples of 9 are 9,18<br />
LCM is 18<br />
As Antonio buys at least 100 of each type, so multiples of 18 are 18,36,54,72,90,108 as 108 is the least number and more than 100 and nearest to 100, so the least number of sheets he might buy= 108</p>

<p>Question 1.<br />
Toby is packaging 21 baseball cards and 12 football cards to sell at a swap meet. Each packet will have the same number of cards. Each packet will have cards for only one sport. What is the greatest number of cards he can place in each packet? How many packets will there be for each sport?</p>
<p>Answer: 7 packets of baseball cards and 4 packets of football cards and each packet contains 3 cards.</p>
<p>Explanation: The GCF of 21 and 12 are<br />
Factors of 21: 1,3,7,21<br />
Factors of 12: 1,2,3,4,6,12<br />
GCF is 3<br />
By Distributive property 21+12<br />
= (3ร7)+(3ร4)<br />
= 3ร(7+4)<br />
So there will be 7 packets of baseball cards and 4 packets of football cards and each packet contains 3 cards.</p>
<p>Question 2.<br />
What if Toby had decided to keep one baseball card for himself and sell the rest? How would your answers to the previous problem have changed?</p>
<p>Answer: 5 packets of baseball cards and 3 football and each packet contains 4 cards.</p>
<p>Explanation: If Toby had decided to keep one baseball card for himself, so he will have 20 baseball cards and 12 football cards<br />
Factors of 20: 1,2,4,5,10,20<br />
Factors of 12: 1,2,3,4,6,12<br />
GCF is 4<br />
By Distributive property 20+12<br />
= (4ร5)+(4ร3)<br />
=4ร(5+3)<br />
So there will be 5 packets of baseball cards and 3 football and each packet contains 4 cards.</p>
<p>Question 3.<br />
Melissa bought 42 pine seedlings and 30 juniper seedlings to plant in rows on her tree farm. She wants each row to have the same number of seedlings. She wants only one type of seedling in each row. What is the greatest number of seedlings she can plant in each row? How many rows of each type of tree will there be?</p>
<p>Answer: 7 rows of pine seedlings and 5 rows of juniper seedling with 6 seedlings in each row.</p>

Factors of 42: 1,2,3,6,7,14,21,42<br />
Factors of 30: 1,2,3,6,10,15,30<br />
GCF is 6<br />
By Distributive 42+30<br />
=(6ร7)+(6ร5)<br />
=6ร(7+5)<br />
So there will be 7 rows of pine seedlings and 5 rows of juniper seedling with 6 seedlings in each row.</p>

Make Sense of Problems A drum and bugle marching band has 45 members who play bugles and 27 members who play drums. When they march, each row has the same number of players. Each row has only bugle players or only drummers. What is the greatest number of players there can be in each row? How many rows of each type of player can there be?</p>
<p>Answer: 9 people in each row, And there will be 5 rows of bugle players and 3 rows of drummers.</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Factors of 45: 1,3,5,9,15,45<br />
Factors of 27: 1,3,9,27<br />

<p>Question 15.<br />
This table shows the average height in inches for girls and boys at ages 8, 10, 12, and 14 years. To find the average growth per year for girls from age 8 to age 12, Emma knew she had to find the amount of growth between age 8 and age 12, then divide that number by the number of years between age 8 and age 12.<br />
<img src="https://i1.wp.com/gomathanswerkey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Go-Math-Grade-6-Answer-Key-Chapter-1-Divide-Multi-Digit-Numbers-img-9.jpg?resize=420%2C148&#038;ssl=1" alt="Go Math Grade 6 Answer Key Chapter 1 Divide Multi-Digit Numbers img 9" width="420" height="148" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
Emma used this expression: (60.50โ50.75)รท4<br />
She evaluated the expression using the order of operations.<br />
Write the expression. (60.50โ50.75)รท4<br />
Perform operations in parentheses. 9.75รท4<br />
Divide. 2.4375<br />
So, the average annual growth for girls ages 8 to 12 is 2.4375 inches. Write a new problem using the information in the table for the average height for boys. Use division in your problem.</p>
<p>Answer: Find the average growth per year for girls 8 to 14.</p>
<p>Explanation: As (62.50-50.75)รท6<br />

<p>Question 12.<br />
Crackers come in packages of 24. Cheese slices come in packages of 18. Andy wants one cheese slice for each cracker. Patrick made the statement shown.<br />
If Andy doesnโt want any crackers or cheese slices left over, he needs to buy at least 432 of each.<br />
Is Patrickโs statement correct? Use numbers and words to explain why or why not. If Patrickโs statement is incorrect, what should he do to correct it?</p>
<p>Answer: Patrick&#8217;s statement is wrong.</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Multiples of 18: 18,36,54,72<br />
Multiples of 24: 24,48,72<br />
LCM is 72<br />
So the least packages he need to buy is 72.</p>
<p>Question 13.<br />
There are 16 sixth graders and 20 seventh graders in the Robotics Club. For the first project, the club sponsor wants to organize the club members into equal-size groups. Each group will have only sixth graders or only seventh graders.<br />
Part A<br />
How many students will be in each group if each group has the greatest possible number of club members? Show your work.</p>
<p>Answer: Each group will have 4 members, and 4 groups of sixth grade and 5 groups of seventh grade.</p>
<p>Explanation: By distributive property 16+20<br />
=(4ร4)+(4ร5)<br />
=4ร(4+5)<br />
So each group will have 4 members, and 4 groups of sixth grade and 5 groups of seventh grade.</p>
<p>Question 13.<br />
Part B<br />
If each group has the greatest possible number of club members, how many groups of sixth graders and how many groups of seventh graders will there be? Use numbers and words to explain your answer<br />

<p>Answer: Total cost is $48.47+$9.45++$4.47+$9.99= $72.38</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Gasoline 13.1ร$3.70= $48.47<br />
Snacks 5ร$1.89= $9.45<br />
Beach toys 3ร$1.49= $4.47<br />
Sun block 1ร$9.99= $9.99<br />

What is the total cost for everything before tax? Show your work.</p>
<p>Answer: $72.38.</p>
<p>Explanation: Total cost is $48.47+$9.45++$4.47+$9.99= $72.38.</p>
<p>Question 14.<br />
Part C<br />
Mr. Hernandez calculates the total cost for everything before tax using this equation.<br />
Total cost = 13.1 + 3.70 ร 5 + 1.89 ร 3 + 1.49 ร 9.99<br />
Do you agree with his equation? Use numbers and words to explain why or why not. If the equation is not correct, write a correct equation.</p>
<p>Answer: No</p>
<p>Explanation: Mr. Hernandez calculated in a wrong way.<br />
Total cost is (13.1ร$3.70)+(5ร$1.89)+(3ร$1.49)+(1ร$9.99)= $72.38.</p>
