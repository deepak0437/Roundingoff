          <p><strong>The table shows the relationship between temperatures measured on the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales.</strong><br />
          <img src="https://i2.wp.com/gomathanswerkey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Go-Math-Grade-8-Answer-Key-Chapter-3-Proportional-Relationships-img-4.jpg?resize=528%2C75&#038;ssl=1" alt="Go Math Grade 8 Answer Key Chapter 3 Proportional Relationships Lesson 1: Representing Proportional Relationships img 4" width="528" height="75" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
          <p>Question 7.<br />
          Is the relationship between the temperature scales proportional? Why or why not?<br />
          ______________</p>
          <p>Answer:<br />
          No. The ratios of the numbers in each column are not equal.</p>
          <p>Explanation:<br />
          Fahrenheit Temperature/Celsius Temperature = 50/10 = 5<br />
          86/30 = 2.87<br />
          122/50 = 2.44<br />
          The relationship is not propotional as the ratio is not constant.</p>
          <p>Question 8.<br />

          Have Ralph open the account with no money, to begin with, and then put $20 every month.</p>
          <p>Question 10.<br />
          Represent Real-World Problems<br />
          Describe a real-world situation that can be modeled by the equation y = \(\frac{1}{20}\)x. Be sure to describe what each variable represents.<br />
          Type below:<br />
          ______________</p>
          <p>Answer:<br />
          If x is the number of nickels you have, y = \(\frac{1}{20}\)x is the amount of money you have in dollars.</p>
          <p><strong>Look for a Pattern</strong></p>
          <p><strong>The variables x and y are related proportionally.</strong></p>
          <p>Question 11.<br />
          When x = 8, y = 20. Find y when x = 42.<br />
          _______</p>
          <p>Answer:<br />
          y = 105</p>
          <p>Explanation:<br />
          x = 8, y = 20<br />
          y/x = 20/8<br />
          y = 20x/8<br />
          when x = 42<br />
          y = (20 × 42)/8<br />
          y = 105</p>
          <p>Question 12.<br />
          When x = 12, y = 8. Find x when y = 12.<br />
          _______</p>
          <p>Answer:<br />
          x = 18</p>
          <p>Explanation:<br />
          x/y = 12/8<br />
          x = 12y/8<br />
          when y = 12<br />
          x = (12 × 12)/8<br />
          x = 18</p>

          _______ miles per hour</p>
          <p>Answer:<br />
          15 miles per hour</p>
          <p>Explanation:<br />
          Total distance traveled by bicyclist = 4.5 mile + 7.5 mile = 12 mile<br />
          Total time taken by bicyclist = (8:48 A.M &#8211; 8:00 A.M) = 48 min = 0.8 hr<br />
          conversion used : ( 1 hour = 60 minute)<br />

          a. At what rate is the water leaking?<br />
          _______ gallons per minute</p>
          <p>Answer:<br />
          1 gallon every 5 minutes, or 0.2 gal/min</p>
          <p>Explanation:<br />
          Rate = (5 &#8211; 3)/(0 &#8211; 10)<br />
          = 2/-10<br />
          = -0.2<br />
          The rate of water leaking is 1 gallon every 5 minutes, or 0.2 gal/min</p>

          Describe methods you can use to show a proportional relationship between two variables, x and y. For each method, explain how you can find the unit rate and the slope.<br />
          Type below:<br />
          ___________</p>
          <p>Answer:<br />
          The ratio of y to x gives the unit rate and slope.</p>
          <p>Explanation:<br />
          If the equation can be written as y = mx, then m is the unit rate and the slope. Graph: When the line passes through the origin, then the value of r at the point (1, r) is the unit rate and the slope.</p>

          Two cars start at the same time and travel at different constant rates. A graph for Car A passes through the point (0.5, 27.5), and a graph for Car B passes through (4, 240). Both graphs show distance in miles and time in hours. Which car is traveling faster? Explain.<br />
          ___________</p>
          <p>Answer:<br />
          Car B</p>
          <p>Explanation:<br />
          The slope and unit rate of speed of Car A is (27.5 &#8211; 0)/(0.5 &#8211; 0) = 27.5/0.5 = 55 mi/h.<br />
          The slope and unit rate of speed of Car B is (240 &#8211; 0)/(4 &#8211; 0) = 240/4 = 60 mi/h.<br />
          60 &gt; 55, so Car B is traveling faster.</p>

          <p>Answer:<br />
          243 gallons</p>
          <p>Explanation:<br />
          The unit rate is 36/2 = 18gal/min.<br />
          So, 1 1/2 minutes after 12 minutes, an additional 18 × 1 1/2 = = 27 gallons will be pumped in.<br />

          The distance Train A travels is represented by d = 70t<br />
          where d is the distance in kilometers and t is the time in hours<br />
          The speed of train A is 70 kilometer per hour<br />
          To find the speed of train B use the table<br />
          Slope = (300 &#8211; 150)/(4 &#8211; 2) = 75<br />

          <p>Explanation:<br />
          Joelle can read 3 pages in 4 minutes,<br />
          y/x = 3/4<br />
          y = 3/4 x<br />
          If x = 6, y = 3/4 × 6 = 4.5<br />
          If x = 8, y = 3/4 × 8 = 6</p>
          <p>Question 7.<br />
          b. Use the values in the table to find the unit rate.<br />
          _______ pages per minute</p>

          0.75 pages per minute</p>
          <p>Explanation:<br />
          3/4 = 0.75<br />
          4.5/6 = 0.75<br />
          6/8 = 0.75<br />
          The unit rate is 0.75 pages per minute</p>
