<p>Explanation:<br />
Number of Horses in the pen = Two or 2.<br />
Number of Horses leave the pen n go to the field = Two or 2.<br />
Number of Horses left in the pen = Number of Horses in the pen &#8211; Number of Horses leave the pen n go to the field<br />
= 2 &#8211; 2<br />
= 0.</p>
<p><strong>DIRECTIONS</strong> Use counters to model this problem. There are two horses in the pen. The horses leave the pen and go to the field. How many horses are in the pen now? Trace the number. Tell a friend what you know about that number.</p>

<p>Explanation:<br />
First way:<br />
Number of Red counters = 4 or Four.<br />
Number of Yellow Counters = One or 1.<br />
Total counters in the first figure = Number of Red counters + Number of Yellow Counters<br />
= 4 + 1<br />
= 5.</p>
<p>Second way:<br />
Number of Red counters = Two or 2.<br />
Number of Yellow Counters = Three or 3.<br />
Total counters in the first figure = Number of Red counters + Number of Yellow Counters<br />
= 2 + 3<br />
= 5.</p>
