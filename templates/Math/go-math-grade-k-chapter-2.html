Answer :<br />
Number of Yellow counters are 5<br />
Number of Red counters are 4<br />
We Notice from the above figure that 4 yellow counters match 4 red counters but we have one extra yellow counter which doesn&#8217;t match any red counter . that means we have one yellow counter.<br />
So, Number of yellow counters are greater than number of red counters.</p>

Answer :<br />
Number of Yellow counters are 1<br />
Number of Red counters are 3<br />
We Notice from the above figure that 1 yellow counter match 1 red counters but we have two extra red counter which doesn&#8217;t match any yellow counter .<br />
So, Number of yellow counters are lesser than number of red counters.</p>
<p><strong>DIRECTIONS</strong> Place counters as shown. Trace the line to match a counter in the top five frame to a counter below it in the bottom five frame. Count how many in each set. Tell a friend which set has a number of objects less than the other set.</p>

Explanation :<br />
In the first column we have 3 pencils and in the column we have 3 pencils. each pencil have its match. this means Number of pencils in the first column compares equally with number of pencils in the second column .</p>
<p><strong>DIRECTIONS 7.</strong> Kendall has a set of three pencils. Her friend has a set with the same number of pencils. Draw to show the sets of pencils. Compare the sets by matching. Write how many in each set. <strong>8.</strong> Draw to show what you know about matching to compare two sets of objects. Write how many in each set.</p>
<p><strong>HOME ACTIVITY</strong><br />
• Show your child two sets with a different number of objects in each set. Have him or her use matching to compare the sets.</p>
