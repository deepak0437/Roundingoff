Look at the angles for all regular polygons. As the number of sides increases, do the measures of the angles increase or decrease? What pattern do you see?<br />
angles measures __________</p>
<p>Answer: Increase</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
As the number of sides increases, the measures of the angles increase.<br />
we know that<br />
The measure of the interior angle in a regular polygon is equal to<br />
x = (n-2)/n(180°)<br />
where<br />
n is the number of sides of the regular polygon.<br />
x is the measure of the interior angle in a regular polygon.</p>

The opposite corners of a quadrilateral are right angles. The quadrilateral is not a rhombus. What kind of quadrilateral is this figure? Explain how you know.<br />
Type below:<br />
_________</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>It depends, is it just one set of opposite angles that are right angles? Then it could be just a quadrilateral, or it could be a kite, or it could be a rectangle. Because a Quadrilateral is the least restrictive, the best answer is. “It is a quadrilateral”.<br />
Or is it both sets of opposite angles are right angles? Then it can only be a “rectangle, that is not a square”.<br />

<img src="https://i1.wp.com/gomathanswerkey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Go-Math-Grade-5-Answer-Key-Chapter-11-Geometry-and-Volume-img-34.jpg?resize=158%2C84&#038;ssl=1" alt="Go Math Grade 5 Answer Key Chapter 11 Geometry and Volume Lesson 4: Properties of Two-Dimensional Figures img 34" width="158" height="84" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
______ lines</p>
<p>Answer: 3 lines</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
From the above figure, we can see that there are 18 congruent squares.<br />
To find the least number of lines Max can draw we have to divide number of squares by number of congruent rectangles<br />
18 ÷ 6 = 3<br />
Thus the least number of lines that Max can Draw is 3 lines.</p>
<p>Question 6.<br />
Of the 95 fifth and sixth graders going on a field trip, there are 27 more fifth-graders than sixth graders. How many fifth graders are going on the field trip?<br />
5th graders = ______</p>
<p>Answer: 61</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Since we are not told how many 6th graders are going on the trip let&#8217;s use a variable, the letter x.<br />
Now let&#8217;s understand the problem in the &#8220;math&#8221; language.<br />
x= the number of 6th graders.<br />
X+27= the number of 5th graders since there are 27 more fifth-graders than sixth graders.<br />
x+x+27 = 95<br />
2x+27=95<br />
-27 -27<br />
2x+ 0 =68<br />
2x=68<br />
divide by 2 on both sides.<br />
x = 34<br />
Now, remember how x+27 = the number of 5th graders going on the trip?<br />
Since we know that x=34, substitute the x as 34+27 which = 61 fifth graders going on the trip.</p>

Sam’s paper route includes all 32 houses on two pairs of parallel streets. If each street has the same number of houses, how many houses are on each street?<br />
Name the parallel streets.<br />
______ houses on each street</p>
<p>Answer: 8</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Given,<br />
Sam’s paper route includes all 32 houses on two pairs of parallel streets.<br />
If each street has same number of houses we have to divide 32 by 4<br />
32 ÷ 4 = 8<br />
Thus there are 8 houses on each street.</p>

<p>Question 11.<br />
There are 38 Cube Houses. Each house could hold 1,000 unit cubes that are 1 meter by 1 meter by 1 meter. Describe the dimensions of a cube house using unit cubes. Remember that the edges of a cube are all the same length.<br />
Each dimension = ______ meters</p>
<p>Answer: 10 meters</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
So each house can hold 1000 cubes that are 1 meter in length.<br />
The house is also shaped like a cube, so you need to cube-root 1000.<br />
The cube-root of 1000 is 10. So the cube house has a length, width, and height of 10 meters.<br />
V = lbh<br />
V = 10 m × 10 m × 10 m = 1000 cu. meter<br />
Thus Each dimension is 10 meters.</p>
<p>Question 12.<br />
The Nakagin Capsule Tower has 140 modules and is 14 stories high. If all of the modules were divided evenly among the number of stories, how many modules would be on each floor? How many different rectangular prisms could be made from that number?<br />
Type below:<br />
_________</p>
<p>Answer: 10 modules on each floor</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
The Nakagin Capsule Tower has 140 modules and is 14 stories high.<br />
Divide 140 modules by 14<br />
140 ÷ 14 = 10<br />
Thus 10 modules would be on each floor.<br />
The factors of 10 are 1, 2, 5.<br />
1 × 10 = 10<br />
2 × 5 = 10<br />
Thus 2 different rectangular prisms can be made from 10 unit cubes.</p>

Each cube = 1 cu in.<br />
Volume = ______ cu ______</p>
<p>Answer: 24 cu. in.</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Given that,<br />
L = 3 in<br />
B = 2 in<br />
H = 4 in.<br />
We know that,<br />
The volume of the cuboid is lb<br />

<p>Answer: 36 cu. ft</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Given that,<br />
L = 6 ft<br />
B = 2 ft<br />
H = 3 ft<br />
We know that,<br />
The volume of the cuboid is lbh<br />
V = 6 ft × 2 ft × 3 ft = 36 cubic feet<br />
V = 36 cu. ft<br />
Therefore the volume for the above figure is 36 cu. ft</p>

<p>Answer: 60 cu. in</p>
<p>Given that,<br />
L = 5 in.<br />
B = 4 in.<br />
H = 3 in.<br />
We know that,<br />
The volume of the cuboid is lbh<br />
V = 5 in × 4 in × 3 in = 60 cubic inches<br />
Thus the volume for the above figure is 60 cu. in.</p>

<p>Explanation:<br />
Let us find the volume for both the figures,<br />
Figure 1:<br />
L = 9 ft<br />
B = 4 ft<br />
H = 3 ft<br />
Volume of the cuboid = lbh<br />
V = 9 × 4 × 3 = 108 cu. ft<br />
Figure 2:<br />
L = 8 ft<br />
B = 5 ft<br />
H = 2 ft<br />
Volume of the cuboid = lbh<br />
V = 8 ft × 5 ft × 3 ft = 120 cu. ft<br />
By seeing the volume for both the figures we can say that 120 cu. ft is greater than 108 cu. ft<br />
Thus, <img src="https://i1.wp.com/gomathanswerkey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Go-Math-Grade-5-Answer-Key-Chapter-11-Geometry-and-Volume-img-90.jpg?resize=290%2C141&#038;ssl=1" alt="Go Math Grade 5 Answer Key Chapter 11 Geometry and Volume Lesson 6: Understand Volume img 90" width="290" height="141" data-recalc-dims="1" /> &gt; <img src="https://i0.wp.com/gomathanswerkey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Go-Math-Grade-5-Answer-Key-Chapter-11-Geometry-and-Volume-img-91.jpg?resize=279%2C127&#038;ssl=1" alt="Go Math Grade 5 Answer Key Chapter 11 Geometry and Volume Lesson 6: Understand Volume img 91" width="279" height="127" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p>Question 7.<br />
What’s the Error? Jerry says that a cube with edges that measure 10 centimeters has a volume that is twice as much as a cube with sides that measure 5 centimeters. Explain and correct Jerry’s error.<br />
Type below:<br />
__________</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
Let v1 equal the 10 cm sided cube&#8217;s volume.<br />
Let v2 equal the 5 cm sided cube&#8217;s volume.<br />
v1 = 10 × 10 10 = 1000 cu. cm<br />
v2 = 5 × 5 × 5 = 125 cu. cm<br />
To find the relationship between the two volumes, divide the first volume by the second.<br />
r = v1 ÷ v2<br />
r = 1000 ÷ 125 = 8<br />
The volume differ by a factor of 8.<br />
Thus the volume differs by a factor of 8, not by a factor of 2.</p>
<p>Question 8.<br />
Pattie built a rectangular prism with cubes. The base of her prism has 12 centimeter cubes. If the prism was built with 108 centimeter cubes, how many layers does her prism have? What is the height of her prism?<br />
layers: ______ the height of the prism: ______ cm</p>
<p>Answer: 9 layers, the height of the prism is 9 cm</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Given:<br />
Pattie built a rectangular prism with cubes.<br />
The base of her prism has 12-centimeter cubes.<br />
The prism was built with 108 cm cubes.<br />
To find the layers divide the number of cubes by base of the prism<br />
That means 108 ÷ 12<br />
108/12 = 9<br />
Thus the prism has 9 layers.<br />
Now we have to find the base of the prism<br />
108 = b × h<br />
12 × h = 108<br />
h = 108/12 = 9<br />
Therefore the height of the prism = 9 cm</p>
<p>Question 9.<br />
A packing company makes boxes with edges each measuring 3 feet. What is the volume of the boxes? If 10 boxes are put in a larger, rectangular shipping container and completely fill it with no gaps or overlaps, what is the volume of the shipping container?<br />
volume of the boxes: __________ cu ft<br />
volume of the shipping container = __________ cu ft</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
the volume of the boxes: 27 cu ft<br />
the volume of the shipping container = 27 cu ft</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
A packing company makes boxes with edges each measuring 3 feet.<br />
Volume of the cube = lbh<br />
V = 3 × 3 × 3 = 27 cubic feet<br />
Thus the volume of the boxes is 27 feet.<br />
The volume of the boxes for 10 boxes is 27 × 10 = 270 cubic feet<br />
Therefore the volume of the shipping container is 27 cu ft</p>

<p>Question 1.<br />
Mr. Price makes cakes for special occasions. His most popular-sized cakes have a volume of 360 cubic inches. The cakes have a height, or thickness, of 3 inches, and have different whole number lengths and widths. No cakes have a length or width of 1 or 2 inches. How many different cakes, each with a different-size base, have a volume of 360 cubic inches?<br />
First, think about what the problem is asking you to solve, and the information that you are given.<br />
Next, make a table using the information from problem.<br />
Finally, use the table to solve the problem.<br />
Type below:<br />
_________</p>
<p>Answer: There are total of 8 different possible combination of length and width</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Volume = 360 cubic inches<br />
Height = 3 inches<br />
Volume = l x w x h<br />
360 = l x w x 3<br />
l x w = 120<br />
The factors of 120 are,<br />
1 x 120,<br />
2x 60,<br />
3 x 40,<br />
4 x 30,<br />
5 x 24,<br />

What if the 360 cubic-inch cakes are 4 inches thick and any whole number length and width are possible? How many different cakes could be made? Suppose that the cost of a cake that size is $25, plus $1.99 for every 4 cubic inches of cake. How much would the cake cost?<br />
Type below:<br />
_________</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
Since the store have a volume of 360 cu in and a height of 4 in.<br />
We need to find the number of different stones which have a base of 90 sq in.<br />
V = b × h<br />
B = 360 cu in/4 in<br />
B = 90 sq in.<br />
Consider the factors of 90.<br />
The factors of 90 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, 90<br />
Make a table with the base, height and volume for each pair of factors<br />
Height = 4 in<br />
1 × 90 × 4 = 360 cu in<br />
2 × 45 × 4 = 360 cu in<br />
3 × 30 × 4 = 360 cu in<br />
5 × 18 × 4 = 360 cu in<br />
6 × 15 × 4 = 360 cu in<br />
9 × 10 × 4 = 360 cu in<br />
6 different sized paving stones.<br />
Remember that each store has a volume of 360 cu in.<br />
Divide by 4 to find how many 4 cu in per stone<br />
Concrete = $0.18 × (360/4)<br />
= $0.18 × 90 = $18.70<br />
The cost of the stone plus the concrete<br />
cost = $2.50 + concrete<br />
Cost = $2.50 + $16.20 = $18.70</p>
<p>Question 3.<br />
One company makes inflatable swimming pools that come in four sizes of rectangular prisms. The length of each pool is twice the width and twice the depth. The depth of the pools are each a whole number from 2 to 5 feet. If the pools are filled all the way to the top, what is the volume of each pool?<br />
Type below:<br />
_________</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
If the depth of the pool is 2 feet<br />
then the length of the pool is twice the width and twice the depth<br />
That means 2 feet × 2 × 2 = 8 feet<br />
Width is twice the depth<br />
W = 2 feet × 2 = 4 feet<br />
The volume of the rectangular swimming pool is l × w × h<br />
V = 8 ft × 4 feet × 2 ft<br />
V = 64 cu ft<br />
If the depth of the pool is 3 feet<br />
then the length of the pool is twice the width and twice the depth<br />
That means 3 feet × 2 × 2 = 12 feet<br />
Width is twice the depth<br />
W = 3 feet × 2 = 6 feet<br />
The volume of the rectangular swimming pool is l × w × h<br />
V = 12 ft × 6 feet × 2 ft<br />
V = 144 cu ft<br />
If the depth of the pool is 4 feet<br />
then the length of the pool is twice the width and twice the depth<br />
That means 4 feet × 2 × 2 = 16 feet<br />
Width is twice the depth<br />
W = 4 feet × 2 = 8 feet<br />
The volume of the rectangular swimming pool is l × w × h<br />
V = 16 ft × 8 feet × 2 ft<br />
V = 256 cu ft<br />
If the depth of the pool is 5 feet<br />
then the length of the pool is twice the width and twice the depth<br />
That means 5 feet × 2 × 2 = 20 feet<br />
Width is twice the depth<br />
W = 5 feet × 2 = 10 feet<br />
The volume of the rectangular swimming pool is l × w × h<br />
V = 20 ft × 10 feet × 2 ft<br />
V = 400 cu ft</p>

<p>Question 7.<br />
A park has a rectangular playground area that has a length of 66 feet and a width of 42 feet. The park department has 75 yards of fencing material. Is there enough fencing material to enclose the playground area? Explain.<br />
______</p>
<p>Answer: Yes</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
A park has a rectangular playground area that has a length of 66 feet and a width of 42 feet.<br />
The park department has 75 yards of fencing material.<br />
Area of the rectangular playground = l × w<br />
A = 66 feet × 42 feet<br />
A = 2772 sq. ft<br />
Perimeter of the rectangular playground = 2l + 2w<br />
P = 2 × 66 + 2 × 42<br />
P = 216 ft<br />
Now convert from feet to yard<br />
We know that 1 yard = 3 feet<br />
216 ft = 1/3 × 216 = 72 yard<br />
72 yard is less than 75 yard<br />
Thus the park department has enough fencing material.</p>

The length is 20 inches and the width is 12 inches.<br />
Volume = l × w × h<br />
1200 cu in = 20 in × 12 in × h<br />
240 sq in × h = 1200 cu in<br />
h = 1200 cu in ÷ 240 sq in<br />
h = 5 in<br />
Thus John&#8217;s chest will be 5 inches tall.<br />
The correct answer is option B.</p>

Volume = ______ cubic centimeters</p>
<p>Answer: 312</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Split the figure into 2 parts.<br />
Figure 1:<br />
h = 3 cm<br />
w = 6 cm<br />
b = 4 cm<br />
V = 4 cm × 6 cm × 3 cm = 72 cu. cm<br />
Figure 2:<br />
b = 10 cm<br />
w = 6 cm<br />
h = 4 cm<br />
V = 10 cm × 6 cm × 4 cm = 240 cu. cm<br />
Now add the volume of 2 figures<br />
72 cu. cm + 240 cu. cm = 312 cu cm<br />
Thus the volume of the composite figure is 312 cu. cm</p>
