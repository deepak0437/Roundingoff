<p>Answer: -15 yards</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
A football team lost 5 yards on each of 3 plays.<br />
The team lost 5 yards 3 times.<br />
3(-5) = (-5) + (-5) + (-5)<br />
To graph 3(-5) we start at 0 and move 5 units to the left 3 times:<br />
-15<br />

<p>Explanation:<br />
The price declined $5 4 times, thus the total change in the price after the 4 days is:<br />
4(-5)<br />
4(-5) = (-5) + (-5) + (-5) + (-5)<br />
To graph 4(-5) we start at 0 and move 5 units to the left 4 times:<br />
4 × -5 = $-20</p>
<p>Question 17.<br />
A mountain climber climbed down a cliff 50 feet at a time. He did this 5 times in one day. What was the overall change in his elevation?<br />

<p>Answer: -250 feet</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
A mountain climber climbed down a cliff 50 feet at a time. He did this 5 times in one day.<br />
5(-50)<br />
5(-50) = (-50) + (-50) + (-50) + (-50) + (-50)<br />
To graph 5(-50) we start at 0 and move 50 units to the left 5 times:<br />
5 × -50 = -250 feet<br />
Thus the overall change in his elevation is -250 feet.</p>

a = b = 1<br />
a &gt; 0, b &lt; 0</p>
<p>Question 30.<br />
Justify Reasoning The sign of the product of two integers with the same sign is positive. What is the sign of the product of three integers with the same sign? Explain your thinking.<br />
Type below:<br />
_______________</p>
<p>Answer: The product will have the sign of the third number.<br />
Explanation:<br />
Let a, b, c be three integers. a, b have the same sign.<br />
We have to find the sign of a. b . c<br />
a . b &gt; 0<br />
Because a, b have the same sign, their product is positive:<br />
The product a.b.c will have the same sign of c because the sign a.b is positive and multiplying it by a positive number leads to a positive number, while multiplying it by a negative number leads to a negative number.<br />
c &gt; 0<br />
a.b.c = (a.b).c &gt; 0<br />
c &lt; 0 = a.b.c = (a.b).c &lt; 0</p>

<p>Question 25.<br />
Communicate Mathematical Ideas Two integers, a and b, have different signs. The absolute value of integer a is divisible by the absolute value of integer b. Find two integers that fit this description. Then decide if the product of the integers is greater than or less than the quotient of the integers. Show your work.<br />
product ___________ quotient</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
Let&#8217;s consider two positive numbers to represent |a| and |b|<br />
Case 1: a = 12, b = -4<br />
a . b = 12 . (-4) = -48<br />
a ÷ b = 12 ÷ (-4) = 3<br />
or<br />
Case 2: a = -12, b = 4<br />
a . b = -12 . 4 = -48<br />
a ÷ b = -12 ÷ 4 = -3<br />
In both the cases the product is smaller than the quotient and the happens because one number is positive and the other negative and because |a| is divisible by |b|<br />
a . b ≤ a ÷ b</p>

<p>Question 28.<br />
Critique Reasoning<br />
Jim found the quotient of two integers and got a positive integer. He added another integer to the quotient and got a positive integer. His sister Kim says that all the integers Jim used to get this result must be positive. Do you agree? Explain.<br />
___________</p>
<p>Answer: Kim is wrong</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
Let a, b, c be three integers.<br />
We note by a, b the first two integers and by c the third one.<br />
a ÷ b &gt; 0<br />
a ÷ b + c  &gt; 0<br />
Because the quotient a ÷ b is positive it means that either a, b are both positive or they are both negative.<br />
Adding the third number to the positive quotient gives a positive result either if c positive or is negative, but having an absolute value smaller than that of the quotient a ÷ b.<br />
Example:<br />
a = -12<br />
b = -2<br />
c = -3<br />
a ÷ b + c = (-12) ÷ (-2) + (-3) = 6 + (-3)<br />
6 &#8211; 3 = 3<br />
3 &gt; 0<br />
Thus kim is wrong.</p>

Persevere in Problem Solving<br />
Lisa is standing on a dock beside a lake. She drops a rock from her hand into the lake. After the rock hits the surface of the lake, the rock’s distance from the lake’s surface changes at a rate of -5 inches per second. If Lisa holds her hand 5 feet above the lake’s surface, how far from Lisa’s hand is the rock 4 seconds after it hits the surface?<br />
________ inches</p>
<p>Answer: 80 inches</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
We use negative values for the distances the rock gets into the water and the distance from Lisa&#8217;s hand until the water&#8217;s surface as both go down.<br />
Convert from feet to inches.<br />
1 feet = 12 inches<br />
5 feet = 5 × 12 = 60 inches<br />
After 4 seconds the distance from Lisa&#8217;s hand will be given by the sum between the distance from Lisa&#8217;s hand until the water&#8217;s surface and the distance traveled by the rock below the water&#8217;s surface.<br />
4(-5) + (-60) = -20 &#8211; 60 = -80<br />
Thus the rock will be 80 inches from Lisa&#8217;s hand.</p>
