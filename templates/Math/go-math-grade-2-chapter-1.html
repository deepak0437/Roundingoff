<p>Answer:<br />
An even number is a number that can be divided into two equal groups.<br />
An odd number is a number that cannot be divided into two equal groups.<br />
There are different ways of writing the same number.<br />
We can count different amounts to 1000.</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
In the above-given question,<br />
An even number is a number that can be divided into two equal groups.<br />
An odd number is a number that cannot be divided into two equal groups.<br />
There are different ways of writing the same number.<br />
for example 0.04, 1/25, 0.22.<br />
We can count different amounts to 1000.<br />
500 + 500 = 1000<br />
250 + 750 = 1000</p>
