<p>Question 1.<br />
The value of the digit 9 is 9 ten thousands, or:</p>
<p>Answer: The place value of the digit 9 in 894,613 is 90,000.</p>
<p>Explanation: Every digit in a number has a place value and the place value can be defined as the value represented by a digit in a number on the basis of its position in the number. So the place value of the digit 9 in 8,94,613 is 90,000.</p>

<p>Answer: The value of 3 in 2,304 is 10 times the value of 3 in 16,135.</p>
<p>Explanation: Every digit in a number has a place value and the place value can be defined as the value represented by a digit in a number on the basis of its position in the number. So the place value of the digit 3 in 2,304 is 300. And the place value of the digit 3 in 16,135 is 30. As each hundred is 10 times as many as 10, so 3 hundreds are ten times as many as 3 tens. So, the value of 3 in 2,304 is 10 times the value of 3 in 16,135.</p>

<p>a. What do you know?</p>
<p>Answer: Mark&#8217;s score will be 300,000+30,000= 330,000.</p>

Since his score is greater than one hundred thousand, which means that three of the balls landed in the section of 100,000 this will make the score 300,000. If the other three balls, landed in the section of 10,000 this will make the score of three balls to be 30,000. Therefore Mark&#8217;s score will be 300,000+30,000= 330,000.</p>

To the nearest hundred, a factory produced 3,600 jars of applesauce on Thursday and 4,200 jars of apple sauce on Friday. To the nearest thousand, how many jars of apple juice did they produce during the two days?</p>
<p>Answer: 7,800 jars.</p>
<p>Explanation:<br />
The number of jars of apple sauce on Thursday= 3,600 jars<br />

<p>Question 16.<br />
Rachael rounded 16,473 to the nearest hundred. Then she rounded her answer to the nearest thousand. What is the final number?</p>
<p>Answer: 17,000.</p>
<p>Explanation: When we round a number to the nearest we check the tens place digit, if the digit is less than 5 then the number is rounded to the previous hundred while if it is 5 or more than 5 then the number is rounded to the next hundred. As tens place digit is 7, so<br />
16,473= 16,500. And when we need to round the number to the nearest thousand and will check the hundred place digit which is 5. So when 16,500 is rounded off to the nearest thousand the value will be 17,000.</p>

<p>During an event, a hot air balloon traveled a distance of 5,110 feet during the first trip and 850 feet more during the second trip. How far did it travel during the second trip?</p>
<p>Question 1.<br />
What do I need to find?</p>
<p>Answer: We need to find the number of feet the balloon traveled during the second trip.</p>
<p>Question 2.<br />
What information do I need to use?</p>
<p>Answer: We will use the facts that the ballon traveled 5,110 feet during the first trip and 850 feet more during the second trip.</p>
<p>Question 3.<br />
How will I use the information?</p>
<p>Answer: We can draw a diagram or use a bar model to help me find how many feet the ballons traveled during the second trip.</p>
<p>Explanation: As hot air balloon traveled a distance of 5,110 feet in the first trip and 850 more in the second trip, so the second trip is 5,110+850= 5,960 feet. So, the balloon traveled 5,960 feet during the second trip.</p>
<p>Question 4.<br />
How far did it travel during the second trip? And<br />
______ feet</p>
<p>Answer: The ballon traveled 5,960 feet during the second trip.</p>
<p>Explanation: As hot air balloon traveled a distance of 5,110 feet in the first trip and 850 more in the second trip, so the second trip is 5,110+850= 5,960 feet. So, the balloon traveled 5,960 feet during the second trip.</p>
<p>Question 5.<br />
Is your answer reasonable? Explain how you know.</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, the answer is reasonable.</p>
<p>Explanation: As 5,960 feet is reasonable because 5,000+1,000= 6,000 and 5,960 is close to 6,000. Since addition and subtraction are inverse operations, we can subtract 850 from the sum to see if we get 5,110.</p>
