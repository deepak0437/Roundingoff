To get to a dog show, Mr. Luna first drives 7 miles west from his home and then 3 miles north. Next, he turns east and drives 11 miles. Finally, he turns north and drives 4 miles to the dog show. How far north of Mr. Luna’s home is the dog show? To solve the problem, Dara and Cliff drew diagrams. Which diagram is correct? Explain.<br />
<img src="https://i1.wp.com/gomathanswerkey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Go-Math-Grade-4-Answer-Key-Chapter-2-Multiply-by-1-Digit-Numbers-img-2.jpg?resize=305%2C320&#038;ssl=1" alt="Go Math Grade 4 Answer Key Chapter 2 Multiply by 1-Digit Numbers img 2" width="305" height="320" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Answer: Cliff diagram is correct.</p>
<p>Explanation: Mr. Luna&#8217;s travels east and west are irrelevant to the question. As he drives 3 miles north, then he drives 4 more miles north. 3 + 4 = 7, so Mr. Luna ends up 7 miles north of his home.</p>

Last, find the total number of seats.<br />
_____ + _____ = _____</p>
<p>Answer: 112+96= 208.</p>
<p>Explanation: As section A has 8 rows and 14 seats each, So 14×8= 112 and Section B has 6 rows and 16 seats each, So 16×6= 96. Total no. of people are seated in Section A and Section B are<br />
112+96= 208.</p>
<p>Question 1.<br />

_____ adults including Mr. Torres</p>
<p>Answer: 13 adults.</p>
<p>Explanation: First we must find total no. of rows, As there are 24 students each group contains 4 students, So 24 4= 6 rows. And one adult sat in each end of the row, So in 6 rows 2 people will sit. Therefore total adults are 6×2=12 adults+ Mr. Torres= 13 adults.</p>

Carol’s: _____ in.         Liz’s: _____ in.</p>
<p>Answer: Carol’s: 22 in., Liz’s: 26in.</p>
<p>Explanation: Ann’s fish is 12 inches longer and Carol’s fish is 10 inches longer than Ann’s fish which means 10+12= 22 inches, So Carol’s fish is 22 inches. Liz’s fish is 2 inches longer than twice the length of Ann’s fish, which means (2×12) +2=24+2= 26 inches.</p>

Mr. Wright bought a 3-pound bag of cat food and a 5-pound bag of dog food. There are 16 ounces in each pound. How many ounces of pet food did Mr. Wright buy?</p>
<p>Answer: 128 ounces.</p>
<p>Explanation: Mr. Wright bought a 3-pound bag of cat food and there are 16 ounces in each pound, So 3×16= 48 ounces and 5pound bag of dog food as 5×16= 80 ounces. So total ounces of pet food are 48+80= 128 ounces.</p>
<p>Question 21.<br />
The sum of two numbers is 31. The product of the two numbers is 150. What are the numbers?</p>
<p>Answer: 6 and 25.</p>
<p>Explanation: Let the numbers be X and Y, So the sum of two numbers is 31 which means X+Y=31 and product of two numbers is 150 which means X×Y=150. So X=31-Y then replace X=31-Y, So (31-Y)×Y= 150, then 31Y-Y^<sup>2</sup> = 150 which is Y^<sup>2 </sup>– 31Y+ 150 = 0. By factorization Y= 25 and X×25= 150 then X= 6. Therefore X= 6 and Y= 25.</p>

<p>Question 13.<br />
Sharon is 54 inches tall. A tree in her backyard is 5 times as tall as she is. The floor of her treehouse is at a height that is twice as tall as she is. What is the difference, in inches, between the top of the tree and the floor of the treehouse?</p>
<p>Answer: 162 inches.</p>
<p>Explanation: Sharon is 54 inches tall and a tree in her backyard is 5 times as tall as she is which means 54×5= 270. And her treehouse is twice as tall as she is which means 54×2= 108 inches. So the difference between the top of the tree and the floor of the treehouse is 270-108= 162 inches.</p>

<p>Question 15.<br />
Airplane tickets to Fairbanks, Alaska, will cost $958 each. Airplane tickets to Vancouver, Canada, will cost $734. How much can the four members of the Harrison family save on airfare by vacationing in Vancouver?</p>
<p>Answer: $896.</p>
<p>Explanation: Airplane tickets cost for Alaska is $958 each. As Harrison family are 4 members so it will cost $958×4= $3,832 And for Vancouver it costs $734 each. So $734×4= $2,936 and Harrison family save $3832-$2936= $896.</p>
<p>Question 16.<br />
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is 2,147 miles from Salt Lake City, Utah, and 2,868 miles from Portland, Oregon. What is the difference in the round-trip distances between Philadelphia and each of the other two cities? Explain whether you need an estimate or an exact answer.</p>
<p>Answer: 1,442 mi.</p>
<p>Explanation: The distance between Philadelphia and Salt Lake is 2,147 miles and round-trip distance is 2×2,147= 4,294 miles. And the distance between Philadelphia and Portland is 2,868 miles and the round-trip distance is 2×2868= 5736 miles. So the difference is<br />

<p>Answer: 160</p>
<p>Explanation: Maggie has 3 binders with 25 stamps each binder, so total stamps are 3×25= 75. And 5 binders with 24 baseball cards in each binder. So total baseball cards are 24×5=120.<br />

<p>Question 10.<br />
The soccer team sells 54 bagels with cream cheese for $2 each and 36 muffins for $1 each during a bake sale. The coach uses the money to buy socks for the 14 players. The socks cost $6 per pair. How much money does the coach have left? Explain how you found your answer.</p>
<p>Answer: $60.</p>
<p>Explanation: Soccer team sells 54 bagels with cream cheese for $2 each, so 54×2= $108 total amount raised by selling bagels with cream cheese. And 36 muffins for $1 each which means 36×$1= $36 raised by selling muffins. So the total amount raised is $108+$36= $144. And he uses the money to buy socks for 14 players and each pair is $6, So 14×$6= $84 needed to buy socks for the players. So $144-$84= $60 left with the coach after buying socks for the players.</p>
