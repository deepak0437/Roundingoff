        <h2>What is Divisibility Test or Division Rules in Mathematics?</h2>
        <p>In maths, the divisibility test or division rules is the shorthand technique or trick used to check whether a large number is divisible by another number without using the division method. When you divide a number with another number and a quotient is a whole number and the remainder is zero, then that number is said to be divisible by another number.</p>
        <h3>Divisibility Rule of 1 with Example</h3>
        <p>There is no specific trick or condition for the divisibility rule of 1 because every number is divisible by 1 and it gives the number itself. For instance, 5638 is divisible by 1 and 8 is divisible by 1.</p>
        <h3>Divisibility Rule of 2 with Example</h3>
        <p>The test of divisibility by 2 is any number should be even or its last digit needs to be an even number i.e., 2,4,6,8 including 0, then the number is divisible by 2. For example, 488 is divisible by 2, as the last digit 8 is divisible by 2 and it is an even number.</p>
        <h3>Divisibility Rule of 3 with Example</h3>
        <p>When the sum of the digits of a given number is divisible by 3 then the number is completely divisible by 3 as per the divisibility test of 3. Hence, the digital root of the number is 0 or 3 or 6 or 9. For example, 576 is divisible by 3 or not. To check it, let's do the summation of all digits ie., 5+7+6 = 18. 18 is divisible by 3 so 576 is divisible by 3.</p>
        <h3>Divisibility Rule of 4 with Example</h3>
        <p>If the last two digits are zero or divisible by 4 then the number is divisible by 4. Now, let's see if 784 is divisible by 4 or not. The last two digits are 84 and it is divisible by 4. So 784 is divisible by 4.</p>
        <h3>Divisibility Rule of 5 with Example</h3>
        <p>The number can be divisible by 5 if it ends with 0 or 5. For example, let's check if 457 is divisible by 5 or not. The last digit of the given number is 7 so it is not divisible by 5. Also, see if this large number is divisible by 5 or not ie., 396524850. This is divisible by 5 because 0 is the last digit of this number.</p>
        <h3>Divisibility Rule of 6 with Example</h3>
        <p>The divisibility rule of 6 is stated as the number is divisible by 6 when it is divisible by both 2 and 3. Check whether the number is even or not and whether the sum of digits is divisible by 3 or not. If two conditions are satisfied then it is divisible by 6.</p>
        <p>For Example, 360 is the number that can be divisible by 6 or not. 360 is the even number and it ends with 0 so the number is divisible by 2. The sum of digits is 9, it is also divisible by 3. Therefore, 360 is divisible by 6.</p>
        <h3>Divisibility Rule of 7 with Example</h3>
        <p>When you want to check the given number is divisible by 7 apply the divisibility rule of 7 which states to double the unit digit and then subtract the result with the remaining digits. Repeat the process until you are left with two digits or a single digit. If the number is 0 or a multiple of 7 then it is divisible by 7.</p>
        <p>For instance, find 987 is divisible by 7 yes or no? After applying the divisibility rule for 7, double the unit digit 7 and subtract with 98, ie., 98 - 14 = 84. The result is a multiple of 7. Hence 987 is divisible by 7.</p>
        <h3>Divisibility Rule of 8 with Example</h3>
        <p>When the last three digits are divisible by 8 or the last three digits are zeros, then the given number is divisible by 8 completely.</p>
        <p>For instance, apply the divisibility rule of 8 on the number 46598. 598 are the last three digits. Now, check whether it is divisible by 8 or not. Here, the hundred digit is odd so we have to apply the odd rule ie., the last two digits plus 4 is divisible by 8, then 46598 is divisible by 8. Here, 98 + 4 = 102 and it is not divisible by 8, so 46598 is not divisible by 8.</p>
        <h3>Divisibility Rule of 9 with Example</h3>
        <p>The test for divisibility by 9 is the same as the divisibility rule for 3. If the sum of all digits is divisible by 9 then the given number is divisible by 9.</p>
        <p>For example, take the number ie., 86240. Do the summation of all digits, 8+6+2+4+0 = 20. The number 20 is not divisible by 9, therefore 86240 is not divisible by 9.</p>
        <h3>Divisibility Rule of 10 with Example</h3>
        <p>Divisibility test for 10 is the number ends with 0 is divisible by 10. For example, 30, 1000, 7000, etc. are divisible by 10.</p>
        <h3>Divisibility Rule of 11 with Example</h3>
        <p>The number is divisible by 11 when the difference of the sum of alternative digits of a given number is divisible by 11.</p>
        <p>For instance, 4568 is divisible by 11 as 4+6 = 10 and 5+8 = 13 now 10-13 = -3, which is not divisible by 11.</p>
        <p>Divisibility Rule of 12 with Example</p>
        <p>Divisibility rule by 12 states that if the number is divisible by both 3 and 4 then the number is divisible by 12. For example, 674 is divisible by 12 or not. Now, add all the digits ie., 6+7+4 = 17. 17 is not divisible by 3. Let's check that 674 is divisible by 4, and the last two digits 74 are not divisible by 4. So, 674 is not divisible by 12.</p>
        <h3>Divisibility Rule of 13 with Example</h3>
        <p>When you multiply the last digit by 4 and add it to the rest of the number, after adding the result should be divisible by 13, then the number is divisible by 13.</p>
        <p>For example, 409 is divisible by 13, multiply 9 by 4 and add it to 40 ie., 40 + (9x4) = 76, 76 is not divisible by 13. Therefore 409 is not divisible by 13.</p>
        <h3>Divisibility Rule of 14 with Example</h3>
        <p>Divisibility Rule of 14 says when the given number is divisible by 2 and 7 both then the number is divisible by 14. 2 and 7 are prime factors of 14.</p>
        <p>For example, 7632 is divisible by 14 or not. The last digit 2 is an even number so it is divisible by 2. Now, check if it is divisible by 7 or not, to do that:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>First, take the last digit 2 and double it ie., 2+2 = 4</li>
        <li>Subtract 4 from the remaining number which is 763 - 4 = 759.</li>
        <li>Repeat the process, take the last digit 9 and double it ie., 18.</li>
        <li>The remaining number is 75 and now subtract with 18 ie. 75-18 = 57.</li>
        <li>As 57 is not divisible by 7. Hence, 7632 is not divisible by 7.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Divisibility Rule of 15 with Example</h3>
        <p>When the number is exactly divisible by 15, then it should divisible by both 3 and 5.</p>
        <p>For example, 540 is divisible by 15.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Check it is divisible by 3: Add all the digits ie., 5+4+0 = 9. 9 is divisible by 3.</li>
        <li>Check it is divisible by 5: The last digit of the number is 0, so it is not divisible by 5.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Hence, 540 is not divisible by 15.</p>
        <h3>Divisibility Rule of 16 with Example</h3>
        <p>If the last four digits of the number formed are divisible by 16 when a thousand place digit is an even number, then the given number is divisible by 16. If a thousand place digit is odd then the number formed by the last three digits plus 8 is divisible by 16.</p>
        <p>For instance, 162448 is the number to check is divisible by 16 or not. Now, see a thousand digits ie., 2 is even or not, it is an even number. Let's check the four last formed digits ie, 2448 formed are divisible by 16. Hence, the number 162448 is divisible by 16.</p>
        <h3>Divisibility Rule of 17 with Example</h3>
        <p>Divisibility test by 17 is like multiplying the last digit by 5 and minus it from the rest of the number, and the end result should be divisible by 17.</p>
        <p>For instance, check if 345 is divisible by 17 or not. First, multiply 5 by 5 times ie., 5x5 = 25, and now subtract 25 from the remaining number in a given number ie., 34 - 25 = 9. Hence, 9 is not divisible by 17.</p>
        <p>Divisibility Rule of 18 with Example</p>
        <p>As per the divisibility rule of 18, if any number is divisible by 2 and 9 both then the given number is exactly divisible by 18. When the number satisfies the two conditions then it is said to be divisible by 18.</p>
        <p>For example, 6589 is divisible by 18 or not. The last digit of the number is 9 which is not an even number so it is not divisible by 2. Now, check it is divisible by 9 or not by summation of all digits ie., 6+5+8+9 = 28. 28 is not divisible by 9. Therefore, the given number 6589 is not divisible by 18.</p>
        <h3>Divisibility Rule of 19 with Example</h3>
        <p>The divisibility rule of 19 is having two rules to be followed to check whether the number is divisible by 19 or not.</p>
        <p><strong>Rule 1: </strong>If the last digit is multiplied by 2 and added to the remaining number in a given number and the result is divisible by 19 then the number is exactly divisible by 19 when it is a small number.</p>
        <p><strong>Rule 2: </strong>If the given number is big, then multiply the last digit by 4 and add it remaining number, it should be divisible by 19.</p>
        <p>For example, let's take 456 is divisible by 19. Initially, multiply the 6 by 2 ie., 6x2 = 12. Now, add 45 and 12 ie., 45+12 = 57. 57 is divisible by 19 so 456 is divisible by 19.</p>
        <h3>Divisibility Rule of 20 with Example</h3>
        <p>If the formed number with the last two digits is divisible by 20 then the given number is divisible by 20. One more version to test the divisibility of 20 is if the ten&rsquo;s digit is even and the unit place is 0 then it is divisible by 20.</p>
        <p>For example, 45890 is divisible by 20 or not. Take the last two digits into consideration and check whether the ten&rsquo;s place digit is even or not. 9 is not an even number although the unit digit is 0, the given number 45890 is not divisible by 20.</p>
        <h3>Divisibility Rule of 21 with Example</h3>
        <p>To test the divisibility of 21 for any number, consider the unit digit and multiply it by 2 and subtract it from the remaining number. The end result must be divisible by 21 so that the given number is divisible by 21.</p>
        <p>For example, 4563 is divisible by 21 or not. Take the last digit (3) and multiply by 2 ie., 3x2 = 6. Now subtract 456 - 6 = 450.</p>
        <p>Repeat the first two steps for the number, 450 ie. 45 - (0x2) = 45-0 = 45 and 45 is not divisible by 21.</p>
        <p>Hence, 4563 is not divisible by 21.</p>
        <h3>Divisibility Rule of 22 with Example</h3>
        <p>According to the divisibility rule for 22, the number is exactly divisible by 22 if it is an even number and the result of alternate subtracting and adding the digits in the number is divisible by 11.</p>
        <p>For instance, let's see if 6034 is divisible by 22 or not. The number is an even number and 6-0+3-4 = 6-1 = 5. Since 5 is not divisible by 11, then 6034 is not divisible by 22.</p>
        <h3>Divisibility Rule of 23 with Example</h3>
        <p>If the last digit is multiplied by 7 and added to the remaining number in a given number then the result should be divisible by 23 to say the given number is divisible by 23 as per the divisibility rule for 23.</p>
        <p>For instance, 657 is divisible by 23 or not. To check it, apply the divisibility rule of 23 ie, 65 + 7x7 = 65 + 49 = 114. It is not divisible by 23 hence 657 is not divisible by 23.</p>
        <h3>Divisibility Rule of 24 with Example</h3>
        <p>The divisibility rule of 24 states if the number is divisible by both 3 and 8 then it is divisible by 24. Remember both conditions should be satisfied to get divisible by 24.</p>
        <p>For example, 45123 is divisible by 24 or not.</p>
        <p>Check by 3: Do add all the digits ie., 4+5+1+2+3 = 15. 15 is divisible by 3.</p>
        <p>Check by 8: Here the last three digits e., 123 are not divisible by 8.</p>
        <p>Hence, 45123 is not divisible by 24.</p>
        <h3>Divisibility Rule of 25 with Example</h3>
        <p>To test if the number is divisible by 25, you need to check whether the last two digits are formed as 00, 25, 50, or 75.</p>
        <p>For example, 7655 is divisible by 25 or not. The formed last two digits are 55 so it is divisible by 25. Therefore, 7655 is divisible by 25.</p>

        <h3>FAQs on Basic Rules of Divisibility with Examples</h3>
        <p><strong>1. How many divisibility rules are there in math?</strong></p>
        <p>In math, there are so many divisibility rules but basically, we have rules of divisibility from 1 to 20. Later, we discussed divisibility rules for 21 to 25 on our page by identifying the pattern of number multiples from other divisibility tests.</p>
        <p><strong>2. What is the formula of divisibility?</strong></p>
        <p>If we found the division problem in an equation using our division algorithm, and r=0, then the following equation is used ie., a = bq.</p>
        <p><strong>3. What is divisibility with example?</strong></p>
        <p>In mathematics, divisibility means a number that is evenly divided by another number, with no remainder and the whole number as a quotient. For example, 30 is divisible by 3 as its quotient is 10 and the remainder is 0.</p>
        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>We hope the information on <strong>divisibility rules from 1 to 25</strong> helped you greatly with your complex division calculations.
