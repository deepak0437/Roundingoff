      <p>Divisibility Rule of 17 is taught here in detail. If you are facing any trouble solving the problems on the division of large numbers by 17 then this page will give you all that you need to know about the tricks. Read more to study the Divisibility Rule for 17, How to Test if a Number is Divisible by 17 or not, and Solved Examples on Divisibility by 17. You need not divide the number manually and by following these simple tips you can decide whether the number is divisible by 17 or not.</p>
      <h2>What is the Divisibility Rule of 17?</h2>
      <p>As per the <a href="/divisibility-rules/">divisivility rule</a> of 17, a number is divisible by 17 if the last digit of the number when multiplied by 5 and subtracted from the rest is divisible by 17. For example, let us take 745. 74 - 5*5 = 74-25 = 49 49 is not divisible by 17. So 745 is not divisible by 17.</p>
      <h3>How to Determine if a Number is Divisible by 17?</h3>
      <p>Go through the simple process mentioned below to see if a Number is divisible by 17 or not. They are along the lines</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Firstly, multiply the last digit of the given number by 5.</li>
      <li>Then, subtract the result from the remaining digits.</li>
      <li>If the result is divisible by 17 then the given number is also divisible by 17.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To better understand this concept of the Divisibility Test of 17 we have given a few worked-out examples.</p>
      <h3>Worked Out Examples on Divisibility Test of 17</h3>
      <p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
      <p>Is 985 divisible by 17?</p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Given number is 985</p>
      <p>Multiply last digit by 5 i.e. 5 x 5 = 25</p>
      <p>Subtract the result obtained above from the remaining number i.e. 98 - 25 = 73</p>
      <p>Since 73 is not divisible by 17 the entire number 985 is not divisible by 17.</p>
      <p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
      <p>Is 1234 divisible by 17?</p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Given number is 1234</p>
      <p>Multiplying the last digit by 5 we have 4 x 5 = 20</p>
      <p>Subtract the result from the remaining number i.e. 123 - 20 = 103</p>
      <p>103/ 17</p>
      <p>17 will not go completely in 103</p>
      <p>Thus, the number 1234 is not divisible by 17.</p>
