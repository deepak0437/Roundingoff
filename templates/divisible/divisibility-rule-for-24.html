      <p><strong>Divisibility Rule for 24:</strong> Do you have an idea about using the divisibility rules? Not really, then check here. The divisibility rule is also called the divisibility test which tells whether any small or large number is divisible by any number. Now see the detailed explanation of the divisibility rule of 24. When any entire number is divided by 24 and it leaves the whole number as a quotient and zero as the remainder then it is directly divisible by 24. Get more details on the same from the below modules and clear all your doubts on divisibility testing proof.</p>
      <h2>What is the Divisibility Rule for 24?</h2>
      <p>The divisibility rule for 24 is a number that meets the condition of the divisibility rule of 3 and 8 both then the number is divisible by 24. If you need to check whether the number is divisible by 24 or not then check if it is divisible by 3 and 8.</p>
      <h3>Step-by-Step Procedure To Determine The Divisibility Test of 24</h3>
      <p>Instructions that are helpful in telling the number is divisible by 24 is listed below, please follow them carefully:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Take the given number and add all the digits to check for 3 divisibility.</li>
      <li>Summation result must be divisible by 3, if yes then the original number is divisible by 24.</li>
      <li>Later, consider the last three digits of the given number and check if it is three zeros or divisible by 8.</li>
      <li>If it is divisible by 8 then the number is divisible by 24.</li>
      <li>Note down that the number should be divisibility by both 3 and 8 then only it is divisibility by 24.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Solved Examples on Rule of Divisibility for 24</h3>
      <p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
      <p>Is 45000 divisible by 24?</p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Given input is 45000</p>
      <p>To divisible by 24, check the divisibility by 3 and 8 both.</p>
      <ol>
      <li><strong>i) Verify with 3 divisibility:</strong></li>
      </ol>
      <p>The sum of all digits should divisible by 3</p>
      <p>Ie., 4+5+0+0+0 = 9</p>
      <p>Divide 9 by 3, and we get 3.</p>
      <p>So 45000 is divisible by 3.</p>
      <ol>
      <li><strong>ii) Verify with 8 divisibility:</strong></li>
      </ol>
      <p>Consider the last three digits if they are zeros then it is divisible by 8 else check whether the last three digits are divisible by 8 or not.</p>
      <p>Here, the last digits are zeros. So 45000 is divisible by 8.</p>
      <p>Thus, 4500 is divisible by both 3 and 8. So it is divisible by 24.</p>
      <p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
      <p>Is 78234 divisible by 24?</p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Given number is 78234</p>
      <p>Check for 3: 7+8+2+3+4 = 24<br />24 is not divisible by 3</p>
      <p>Check for 8: last three digits are 234</p>
      <p>Divide 234 / 8 = 29.25</p>
      <p>29.25 is not divisible by 8</p>
      <p>Hence, 78234 is not divisible by 24.</p>
