      <h2>What is the Divisibility Rule of 11?</h2>
      <p>The divisibility rule of 11 states that the difference between the sum of the digits at odd places and the sum of the digits at even places of the given number is &ldquo;0&rdquo; or divisible by 11. Then the given number is divisible by 11.&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Step by Step Process To Find Divisibility by 11</h3>
      <p>Here we are going to look into the steps to find the divisibility of 11 easily and manually. Go through the guidelines carefully.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Note down the number that was given in the problem.</li>
      <li>Now, start looking for even or odd position numbers from the leftmost or rightmost digit of the given number.</li>
      <li>Look for digits at all odd places in the number and find the sum of all digits.</li>
      <li>Find the sum of all digits in the even positions that were available in that number.</li>
      <li>After that, look for the difference in sum that was obtained for even and odd positions.</li>
      <li>If the difference is zero or it is divisible by 11 then the given number is divisible by 11.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Example On Divisible by 11&nbsp;</h3>
      <p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Is 86416 divisible by 11?</p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Given number is 86416</p>
      <p>Sum of digits in the even position = 6+1 = 7</p>
      <p>Sum of digits in the odd position = 8+4+6 = 18.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The difference between the sum obtained by even and odd positions is&nbsp;</p>
      <p>18 - 7 = 11</p>
      <p>As level is divisible by 11. Then the number 86416 is divisible by 11.</p>
