    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>The divisibility rules of 6 are helpful to say whether any given number is divisible by 6 or not. It says that when a number is perfectly divisible by 6, it leaves the remainder as zero and the whole number as a quotient. So check the divisibility rules for all numbers to tell the divisibility of the number without performing the division operation. Here we are giving the <a href="/divisibility-rules/">divisivility rule</a> for 6 definitions with examples. Also, check the steps to find the divisibility by six and other useful data.</p>
      <h2><strong>What is the Divisibility Rule for 6?</strong></h2>
      <p>To say that a whole number is divisible by 6 it should satisfy the following two conditions.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>The given number should be divisible by 2. A number is divisible by 2 when the unit place of the number is even i.e 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8.</li>
      <li>The given number must be divisible by 3. A number is divisible by 3 when the sum of all digits of the number is divisible by 3.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The number should fulfil both conditions to do the divisibility test of 6. If the number doesn't satisfy both conditions, then it is not divisible by 6.</p>
      <h3><strong>How to Find Divisibility by Six?</strong></h3>
      <p>The procedure to perform the divisibility test by 6 are listed here:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Observe whether the given number is even or odd. If the number ends with 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 then it is an even number.</li>
      <li>All the even numbers are divisible by 2.</li>
      <li>Calculate the sum of all digits of the number. If the sum is divisible by 3 then the number is divisible by 3.</li>
      <li>If the given whole number satisfies both divisible by 3 and 2, then the number is said to be divisible by 6.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><strong>Divisibility Test for 6 Examples</strong></h3>
      <p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
      <p>Find whether the number 4590 divisible by 6 or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Given number is 4590</p>
      <p>The number ends with 0, so it is an even number</p>
      <p>Hence 4590 is divisible by 2.</p>
      <p>The sum of digits of the number = 4 + 5 + 9 + 0 = 18</p>
      <p>18 is divisible by 3</p>
      <p>So, 4590 is divisible by 3</p>
      <p>Therefore, 4590 is divisible by 6 as it is divisible by both 2 and 3 numbers.</p>
      <p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
      <p>Check whether the number 15873 is divisible by 6 or not by using the divisibility test of 6.</p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Given number is 15873</p>
      <p>The number ends with 3 so it is an odd number</p>
      <p>And the number 15873 is not divisible by 2</p>
      <p>The sum of digits in 15873 = 1 + 5 + 8 + 7 + 3 = 24</p>
      <p>24 is divisible by 3, so 15873 is divisible by 3</p>
      <p>Therefore, 15873 is not divisible by 6 as it is not divisible by 2.</p>
