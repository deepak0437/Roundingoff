      <h2>What is the Divisibility Rule of 3?</h2>
      <p>As per the Divisibility Rule of 3, a number is completely divisible if the sum of the digits in it is divisible by 3 or a multiple of 3. For example, let us take 324</p>
      <p>Sum of digits = 3+2+4 = 9</p>
      <p>9/3 = 3</p>
      <p>Therefore, 324 is divisible by 3.</p>
      <h3>How do you Calculate Divisibility by 3?</h3>
      <p>Go through the simple condition over here to know about the Divisibility Rule of 3.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>The first and foremost step is to identify the given number.</li>
      <li>Then, find the sum of digits of the given number.</li>
      <li>If the sum of digits is a multiple of 3 then the given number is completely divisible by 3.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Solved Examples of Testing Divisibility by 3</h3>
      <p>To help you better understand the Divisibility Rule of 3 we have provided some solved examples below.</p>
      <p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
      <p>Check whether 428 is divisible by 3 or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Given number is 428</p>
      <p>We know as per the divisibility rule of 3, that a number is divisible only if the sum of digits is divisible by 3 or a multiple of 3.</p>
      <p>Sum of digits = 4+2+8 = 14</p>
      <p>Now dividing 14&divide;3 we have the remainder of 2.</p>
      <p>As 14 is not completely divisible by 3 we can say that 428 is not divisible by 3.</p>
      <p><strong>Example 2.</strong></p>
      <p>Check if 516 is divisible by 3.</p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Given number is 516</p>
      <p>From the divisibility test of 3, we know if the sum of digits is divisible by 3 or a multiple of 3 then the given number is divisible by 3.</p>
      <p>Sum of digits = 5+1+6 = 12</p>
      <p>As 12 is a multiple of 3 we can say that the given number 516 is divisible by 3.</p>
