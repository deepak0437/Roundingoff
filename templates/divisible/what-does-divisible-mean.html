        <h2>What is meant by Divisible or Divisibility?</h2>
        <p>A Number is said to be divisible by another number if it leaves a remainder of 0. We have a certain set of rules namely Divisibility Rules that tell if a particular number is divisible by another number or not.</p>
        <h3>List of Divisibility Rules for Numbers 2 to 10</h3>
        <p>Below we have mentioned some of the divisibility rules for various numbers starting from 2 to 10. Go through them and check if a number is divisible or not easily next time even in case of large numbers.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Divisible by 2: If the number is even or ends in digits 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 it is divisible by 2.</li>
            <li>Divisible by 3: If the sum of all the digits in the number is divisible by 3 then the number is divisible by 3.</li>
            <li>Divisible by 4: If the last two digits of the number are divisible by 4 then the number is divisible by 4.</li>
            <li>Divisible by 5: If the last digit of the given number is either 0 or 5 then the given number is divisible by 5.</li>
            <li>Divisible by 6: If the given number is divisible by both 2 and 3 then it is divisible by 6.</li>
            <li>Divisible by 7: If the difference between the last digit doubled and the rest of the digits is divisible by 7 then the number is divisible by 7.</li>
            <li>Divisible by 8: If the last three digits of the given number are divisible by 8 then the given number is divisible by 8.</li>
            <li>Divisible by 9: If the sum of the digits of the given number is divisible by 9 then the given number is divisible by 9.</li>
            <li>Divisible by 10: If the last digit of the given number is 0 then it is divisible by 10.</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Fun Facts about Divisibility</h3>
        <p>Below is the list of fun facts that you need to know regarding Divisible Rules. They are as follows</p>
        <ul>
        <li aria-level="1">Each and Every Number is divisible by 1.</li>
        <li aria-level="1">If a Number is divisible by another number then it is also divisible by its factors.</li>
        <li aria-level="1">If a Number is divisible by 6 then it is also divisible by 2 and 3.</li>
        <li aria-level="1">Look at the end digits or sum of digits to check their divisibility by 2, 3, 5, 10, or 9.</li>
        </ul>
