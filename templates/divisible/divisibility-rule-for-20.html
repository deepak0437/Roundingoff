      <p><strong>Divisibility Rule for 20 (Divisibility Test for 20): </strong>Guys who are wondering to solve the given number is divisible by 20 or not in seconds can check this guide without fail. Here, on this page, we are going to discuss what is the divisibility rule of 20 with examples, how to check whether the number is divisible by 20 or not, a simple trick to tell if a number is divisible by 20 or not with the divisibility test for 20 proof.</p>
      <h2>What is the Divisibility Rule of 20?</h2>
      <p>The divisibility rule of 20 states the number that satisfies the two conditions is divisible by 20. The first condition is like the remainder should be zero. The second condition is the number should have zero at the unit place and the tens digit must be even then it is divisible by 20.</p>
      <h3>How to See Step-by-Step Process of Divisibility Test of 20?</h3>
      <p>Here is the complete step-by-step solution for the divisibility rule of 20.</p>
      <p>To determine the smallest prime possible that divides the number, we use the finding prime factorization of a number procedure. Done with the division process till left with 1 as the remaining quotient.</p>
      <p>Hence, if we want the prime factorization of a and we find x to be the least prime that divides a, then we take a/x for the next step and determine the least prime factor to proceed with the process.</p>
      <p>In the end, we get the prime factors and it is written in multiplied form.</p>
      <p>Now, check the prime factorization for 20 using long division and find the prime factors of 20.</p>
      <p>After completing the long division for 20, the prime factorization of 20 is 2 x 2 x 5 = 4 x 5 = 2 x 10</p>
      <p>Therefore, the divisibility test of 20 is if the number is divisible by 4 and 5 both then the number is divisible by 20 because 4, 5 are two prime numbers of 20.</p>
      <p>Also, the number is divisible by 20 if the last two digits are zeros or if the tens digit is even and one&rsquo;s digit is zero.</p>

      <h3>Divisibility Rule for 20 Proof</h3>
      <p>Here, we will see how to prove the Divisibility of 20 by taking an example.</p>
      <p>Let&rsquo;s assume the number is 2500</p>
      <p>Now, check for the divisibility rule for 20;</p>
      <p>The number at the units place = 0</p>
      <p>The number at ten&rsquo;s place = 0</p>
      <p>As per the test of divisibility by 20, the last two digits are zero then it is divisible by 20.</p>
      <p>Hence, the 2500 number is divisible by 20. So, it is proven.</p>
      <h3>FAQs on How to Find if a Number is Divisible by 20 or Not?</h3>
      <p><strong> How is a number divisible by 20?</strong></p>
      <p>A number is exactly divisible by 20 if the last digit of the number is 0 and ten&rsquo;s digit is even. The numbers 00, 20, 40, 60, 80, &hellip; are all divisible by 20.</p>
      <p><strong> What is another trick to check if the number is divisible by 20?</strong></p>
      <p>When the number is divisible by 4 and 5 then the number is divisible by 20.</p>
      <p><strong> Is 257 divisible by 20?</strong></p>
      <p>257 is not divisible by 20 because the last digit is 7 and is not 0, the tens place is having an odd number ie., 5.</p>
