    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>In grade school, everyone of us learn some simple tips and tricks for the divisibility of small numbers like 2, 3, and 5. But most of us are not well known about the simple steps for divisibility by 7. So, in this article, we are going to know simple tricks on how to check if the number is divisible by 7 or not easily. In further sections, we are going to know more information like what is the <a href="/divisibility-rules/">divisivility rule</a> of 7, how to test divisibility by 7, and many more. Start Reading Now!!</p>
      <h2>What is the Divisibility Test For 7?</h2>
      <p>If we need to test whether the given number is divisible by 7 or not you need to subtract twice the unit digit of the number from the remaining number. Then if the number is equal to 0 or is a multiple of 7 then the whole number is divisible by 7.</p>
      <h3>How to Test If the Number is Divisible by 7?</h3>
      <p>Look into some steps to know whether the given number is divisible by 7 or not easily and quickly. Check them below carefully.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>For the given number subtract the last digit twice from the remaining number.</li>
      <li>If the result is equal to 0 or the multiples of 7.</li>
      <li>Then, the whole number is divisible by 7.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Divisibility Rule For 7 Examples</h3>
      <p>Here we are going to give some examples to understand the divisibility rule of 7.</p>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
      <p>Is 789 divisible by7?</p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Given number is 789</p>
      <p>The last digit of this number is 9.</p>
      <p>If you double the last digit you will get the number 18.</p>
      <p>The remaining part of the number is 78.</p>
      <p>Now, take the difference between 78 and 18.</p>
      <p>= 78 -18</p>
      <p>= 60.</p>
      <p>As 60 is not divisible by 7, the whole number is not divisible by 7.</p>
