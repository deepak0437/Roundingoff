      <p>The divisibility test of 14 checks of the number is divisible by 14 or not. If any number is completely divisible by 14 then the quotient will be a whole number and the remainder is zero. In simple words, the divisibility rule for 14 says that if a number is divisible by 14 then it should be divisible by both 7 and 2. Check the complete information about the test of divisibility for 14, the steps on how to prove it and solved questions.</p>
<h2><strong>What is the divisibility rule of 14?</strong></h2>
<p>Any even number which is divisible by 7 is divisible by 14. The divisibility of 7 states that subtract the double of the last digit from the remaining digits of the number. If the difference is a multiple of 7, then the number is divisible by 7.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Take number 224.</p>
<p>Subtraction = 22 - (4 x 2) = 22 - 8 = 14</p>
<p>14 is divisible by 14</p>
<p>So, 224 is divisible by 7 and it is divisible by 2</p>
<p>Therefore, 224 is divisible by 14</p>
<h3><strong>Process to Check If any Number Divisible by 14</strong></h3>
<p>Here is the step-by-step procedure to check if a number is divided by 14 or not.</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider any number.</li>
<li>Check whether the number is even or odd.</li>
<li>If an even number, then double the end digit.</li>
<li>Subtract the product from the remaining digits of the number.</li>
<li>When the difference is divisible by 7, then the number is divisible by 14.</li>
<li>Either the number is odd or the difference is not a multiple of 14 then the number is not divisible by 14</li>
</ul>

      <h3><strong>Divisibility Test for 14 Worked Problems</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Problem 1:</strong></p>
<p>Prove that 20622 is divisible by 14.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Given number is 20622</p>
<p>A number is an even number so it is divisible by 2</p>
<p>Double of the last digit is 2 x 2 = 4</p>
<p>Subtraction = 2062 - 4 = 2058</p>
<p>Double of the last digit = 8 x 2 = 16</p>
<p>Subtraction = 205 - 16 = 189</p>
<p>Double of the last digit = 9 x 2 = 18</p>
<p>Subtraction = 18 - 18 = 0</p>
<p>So, 20622 is divisible by 7</p>
<p>Thus, 20622 is divisible by 14.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 2:</strong></p>
<p>Is 2870 divisible by 14.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Given number is 2870</p>
<p>The number ends with 0 so it is an even number</p>
<p>Double of the last digit is 0 x 2 = 0</p>
<p>Subtraction = 287 - 0 = 287</p>
<p>287 is a multiple of 7</p>
<p>So, 2870 is divisible by 14</p>
<h3><strong>FAQs on Divisibility Rule of 14</strong></h3>
<p><strong> Which is not divisible by 14?</strong></p>
<p>All the odd numbers are not divisible by 14?</p>
<p><strong> How do you know if divisibility is 14?</strong></p>
<p>The divisibility for 14 is when a number is divisible by both 2 and 7 then the number is exactly divisible by 14.</p>
<p><strong> Write an example for divisibility by 14?</strong></p>
<p>252 is an example of a divisibility rule for 14.</p>
<p>252 is an even number so it is divisible by 2</p>
<p>Double of the end digit is 2 x 2 = 4</p>
<p>Subtraction = 25 - 4 = 21</p>
<p>As 21 is divisible by 7, 252 is also divisible by 7</p>
<p>252 is divisible by both 7 and 2</p>
<p>Hence 252 is divisible by 14.</p>
