      <p>Do you need any help to solve the divisibility of 12 problems? If yes, then you must refer to Divisibility for 12 statements with examples. The divisibility test for 12 is helpful to tell if a number is completely divided by the number twelve without performing the whole division process. So it makes your work easier and quicker. Avail the detailed steps on how to test the <a href="/divisibility-rules/">divisivility rules</a> by 12 and solved questions.</p>
      <h2><strong>What is the Divisibility Rule for 12?</strong></h2>
      <p>If a number is divisible by both 3 and 4, then the number is divisible by 12</p>
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> 2340 is divisible by 12</p>
      <p>Sum of digits = 2 + 3 + 4 + 0 = 9 and it is divisible by 3</p>
      <p>Last two digits = 40 which is divisible by 4</p>
      <p>So, 2340 is divisible by 12</p>
      <h2><strong>Guidelines To Test Divisibility of 12</strong></h2>
      <p>Have a look at the manual steps to test if the number is divisible by 12 or not.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Firstly, take any number.</li>
      <li>Now, add all the digits in the number together.</li>
      <li>Check if the sum is divisible by 3.</li>
      <li>Test if the last 2 digits of the number are divisible by 4.</li>
      <li>If steps 3 and 4 are true, then the number is divisible by 12</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><strong>Solved Examples on Divisibility by 12</strong></h3>
      <p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
      <p>Check if 8520 is divisible by 12 or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
      <p>Given number is 8520</p>
      <p>The sum of the digits = 8 + 5 + 2 + 0</p>
      <p>= 15</p>
      <p>As 15 is divisible by 3, 8520 is also divisible by 3</p>
      <p>The last two digits of the number = 20</p>
      <p>20 is divisible by 4 so 8520 is divisible by 4</p>
      <p>According to the test of divisibility by 12, the number 8520 is divisible by 3 and divisible by 4 therefore 8520 is divisible by 12</p>
      <p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
      <p>Check if 1265 is divisible by 12 or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
      <p>Given number is 1265</p>
      <p>Sum of the digits = 1 + 2 + 6 + 5 = 14</p>
      <p>14 is not divisible by 3</p>
      <p>So, 1265 is also not divisible by 3</p>
      <p>The last two digits = 65</p>
      <p>65 is not divisible by 4</p>
      <p>So, 1265 is not divisible by 4</p>
      <p>As 1265 is not divisible by both 4 and 3 hence 1265 is not divisible by 12.</p>
