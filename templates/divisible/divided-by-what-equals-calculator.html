        <h2>Divided by What Equals Formula</h2>
        <p>The formula to calculate divided by what equals is given by the equation <strong>Z/X = Y</strong> where Z is the numerator value, X is the denominator and Y is the result. Here X is the unknown value we need to solve for.</p>
        <h2>How to Calculate Divided by What Equals?</h2>
        <p>The process to find out Divided by What Equals is given below. They are along the lines</p>
        <ul>
        <li>The first and foremost step is to identify the given inputs and unknown values to be found.</li>
        <li>Then, plug in the inputs in the formula divided by what equals i.e. Z/X = Y</li>
        <li>Using the cross multiplication technique rewrite the equation.</li>
        <li>Solve for the unknown value easily.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Solved Examples on Divided by What Equals</h3>
        <p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
        <p>Solve the equation 4 divided by What Equals 12?</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
        <p>We know the formula for Divided by What Equals is Z/X = Y</p>
        <p>Plugging in the known inputs in the above formula we get the equation as such i.e. 4/X = 12</p>
        <p>Cross multiplying we get 4 = 12X</p>
        <p>X = 4/12</p>
        <p>X = 1/3</p>
        <p>X= 0.333</p>
        <p>Therefore 4 divided by 0.333 equals 12.</p>
        <p><strong>Example 2.</strong></p>
        <p>Solve 100 Divided by What Equals 50?</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
        <p>As per the formula of Divided by What Equals Z/X = Y</p>
        <p>Input these values in the above formula i.e. 100/X = 50</p>
        <p>Cross multiplying we have 100 = 50X</p>
        <p>100/50 = X</p>
        <p>X = 2</p>
        <p>Therefore, 100 Divided by 2 Equals 50.</p>
