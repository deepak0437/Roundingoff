      <p>Here in this article, we have discussed the complete <strong>Divisibility Rule for 22</strong>. Students who ever felt testing divisibility by 22 is tough while huge number calculations can apply this divisibility rule. The divisibility Test of 22 tricks will assist you to solve whether the number is divisible by 22 or not. So, know more about the rule of divisibility by 22, How to Test if a Number is Divisible by 22 or not, and Solved Examples on Divisibility Test by 22 from the below modules and make your math calculations of division more simple &amp; easy.</p>
      <h2>What is the Divisibility Rule for 22?</h2>
      <p>The divisibility test of 22 states that if the number is divisible by both 2 and 11 then it is divisible by 22. By using this divisibility rule for 22, you can easily determine the number is divisible by 22. Check the below steps and learn how to test divisibility by 22 along with a solved example.</p>
      <h2>Simple Steps on How Do You Check Number is Divisible by 22?</h2>
      <p>The following process will help you test whether the number is divisibility by 22 or not:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Firstly, the rule says the number must be divisible by 2 and 11.</li>
      <li>Check for 2: If the last number is even like 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 then it is divisible by 2.</li>
      <li>Check for 11: Do alternate subtracting and adding the digits in the number and the final result should be 0 or divisible by 11.</li>
      <li>If both conditions are true then the number is divisible by 22. Look at the below module for a solved example and understand how the 22 divisibility test is applied.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Worked Out Example on How To Test If Number is Divisible by 22?</h3>
      <p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
      <p>Find whether the 8-digit number 1862383A is divisible by 22 or not with the value of A.</p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Given input</p>
      <p>The 8-digit number is 1862383A.</p>
      <p>Use the divisibility rule of 22 and check whether the number is divisible by 22 or not:</p>
      <p>In the first step, check for the 2 divisibility rule:</p>
      <p>According to the rule, the unit place digit should be an even number to be divisible by 2. Here A is the last digit so the possible values of A are 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8.</p>
      <p>In the next step, check for 11 divisibility rule:</p>
      <p>As per the rule of Divisibility by 11, we get</p>
      <p>&rArr; (8 + 2 + 8 + A) - (1 + 6 + 3 + 3) = 0 or multiple of 11</p>
      <p>&rArr; 18 + A - 13 = 0 or multiple of 11</p>
      <p>&rArr; 5 + A = 0 or multiple of 11</p>
      <p>If A = 6 then the 8-digit number 1862383A is divisible by 22. Thus A value becomes 6.</p>
