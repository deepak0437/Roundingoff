      <h2>What is the Divisibility Rule of 10?</h2>
      <p>This divisibility rule is a method to know whether the given number is divisible by another fixed number or not. The divisibility rule of 10 states that if the last digit of the number ends with &lsquo;&rsquo;zero&rdquo; then it is divisible by 10.</p>
      <p>For example, the numbers 20, 40, 170, and 990 are all divisible by 10 because the last digit of the numbers are zero. On the other hand, 21, 34, and 127 are not divisible by 10 as the numbers don&rsquo;t end with zero.</p>
      <h3>Solved Examples on Divisible by 10</h3>
      <p><strong>Examples :</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Is 50 divisible by 10?</p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Given number is 10</p>
      <p>As we know,</p>
      <p>The number which has zero in the last digit is divisible by 10.</p>
      <p>Now, 50 has the last digit as zero, so it is divisible by 10.</p>
      <p>Therefore the number 50 is divisible by 10.</p>
      <p><strong>Question 2:</strong> Is 565986785 divisible by 10?</p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Given the number is 10</p>
      <p>As we know,</p>
      <p>The number which has zero in the last digit is divisible by 10.</p>
      <p>Now, 565986785 which was given in the problem doesn&rsquo;t have the last digit as zero, so it is not divisible by 10.</p>
      <p>Therefore the 565986785 number is not divisible by 10.</p>
