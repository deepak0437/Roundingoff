    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>Divisibility rules are simple tricks to remember easily whether the given number is divisible by another number or not without any division form. Here in this article, for students, we have provided the divisibility rule of 15 with the complete information. So by studying this, you need not face any problems with the division of large numbers as we are using a simple trick to check whether the number is divisible by 15 or not.</p>
      <h2>What is the Divisibility Rule for 15?</h2>
      <p>The <a href="/divisibility-rules/">divisivility rule</a> of 15 states that the number is divisible by 15 only if the given number is divisible by 3 and 5. Otherwise, the number will not be divisible by 15. So, we first need to check whether the number is divisible by 3 or not. For that, you need to know the divisibility rules of 3 and 5.</p>
      <h3>How to Test Divisibility of 15?</h3>
      <p>Check the steps that are given below to know whether the number is divisible by 15 or not.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Take any large or small number.</li>
      <li>Then, first check that the given number will be divisible by 3.</li>
      <li>After that, check whether the given number is divisible by 5.</li>
      <li>Then, if the above two conditions are successful you can undoubtedly tell that the number is divisible by 15.</li>
      <li>If 3 or 5 any of the numbers is not divisible by 5 then the number will not be divisible by 15.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Example Problem For Divisibility Test For 15</h3>
      <p>Look into the solved examples to understand the divisibility rule of 15 easily.</p>
      <p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
      <p>Is 41295 divisible by 15?</p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Given, 41295</p>
      <p>According to the divisibility rule of 15, you need to check whether the number is divisible by 3 and 5 or not.</p>
      <p><strong>Divisibility Rule of 3:</strong></p>
      <p>If the sum of all digits is divisible by 3 then the number will be divisible by 3.</p>
      <p>4+1+2+9+5 = 21</p>
      <p>Yes, 41295 is divisible by 3.</p>
      <p><strong>Divisibility Rule of 5:</strong></p>
      <p>If the digit in one's place is 5 then the number is divisible by 5.</p>
      <p>Here, 41295 the unit digit is 5, so it is divisible by 5.</p>
      <p>As the number is divisible by 3 and 5 the whole number is divisible by 15.</p>
