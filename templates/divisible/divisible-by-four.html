      <h2>Divisibility Test of 4 | What is the Divisibility Rule of 4?</h2>
      <p>The divisibility test of 4 works like this, if the last two digits of the number are divisible by 4 or the zeros then the actual number is divisible by 4. Also, it is called the divisibility rule of 4.</p>
      <p>For Example, let&rsquo;s check with 124 is divisible by 4 or not. The last two digits of 124 are 24 and it can be divisible by 4. The quotient is 5 and the remainder is 0, so 124 is divisible by 4.</p>
      <h3>Solved Example on How To Tell if a Number is Divisible by 4?</h3>
      <p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
      <p>Is 460 divisible by 4?</p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Given number is 460</p>
      <p>We know that the divisibility rule of 4 says the last two digits of a number are divisible by 4 then it is divisible by 4, so divide the last two digits by 4.</p>
      <p>i.e., 460 means 60 divided by 4</p>
      <p>After dividing 60 by 4, the quotient is 15 and the remainder is 0</p>
      <p>So, 460 is divisible by 4.</p>
