    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>When you share food or split anything equally between you and your friend you need to know how to divide it equally into 2. Likewise, in numbers that may be large or small if you like to divide the number by 2 then you need to know simple logic on how to do it. On this page, the <a href="/divisibility-rules/">divisivility rule</a> of 2 helps you to check whether the given number is divisible by 2 or not.</p>
      <p>Check out this article and learn how to divide the number by 2 easily and quickly by using a simple rule.</p>
      <h2>What is the Divisibility Rule of 2?</h2>
      <p>The divisibility rule for 2 is a short form to check whether the number was divided by 2 without solving it in the division form. This rule says that the number that ends with 0,2,4,6,8 and so on with any prime number will be divisible by 2.</p>
      <h3>Proof of Divisibility Test of 2</h3>
      <p>We can prove this divisibility rule of 2 using an example.</p>
      <p>Let us take any number as an example</p>
      <p>Consider, the number 73882</p>
      <p>According to the rule, if the last digit of the number ends with an even number then it is divisible by 2.</p>
      <p>Now, as the given number ends with the even number, it is divisible by 2</p>
      <p>73882 / 2 = 36941 with the remainder 0.</p>
      <p>Since 73882 is divisible by 2.</p>
      <h3>Application of Divisible by 2 Rule</h3>
      <p>Let us look into some of the applications in that you can use the divisibility rule for 2.</p>
      <p>Mary has 26 crackers that she wants to share with Nancy in break time. Is it possible for her and Nancy to split the crackers up evenly between them? If three of the crackers fall on the floor, and they need to be thrown out, is it possible to split up the remaining crackers evenly between Mary and Nancy?</p>
      <p>Here we are going to split this application into two cases. In the first case, mary can split the crackers evenly with nancy as there are 26 crackers, as the divisibility rule applies. Because 26 ends with an even number. So they can evenly spread the crackers for both of them. In the second case as three crackers have fallen down, mary has only 21 crackers as the number does not end with an even number, they cannot be spread evenly for both of them.</p>

      <p><strong>List of Numbers divisible by 2:</strong> The Numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86, 88, 90, 92, 94, 96, 98, 100, 102, 104, 106, 108, 110, 112, 114, 116, 118, 120, 122, 124, 126, 128, 130, 132, 134, 136, 138, 140, 142, 144, 146, 148, 150, 152, 154, 156, 158, 160, 162, 164, 166, 168, 170, 172, 174, 176, 178, 180, 182, 184, 186, 188, 190, 192, 194, 196, 198, 200, etc. are divisible by 2 because their units place is either 0 or multiple of 2.</p>
      <h3>FAQs on Test of Divisibility by 2</h3>
      <p><strong>1. What is the rule for 2?</strong></p>
      <p>Any number that ends with the even numbers like 0,2,4,6,8&hellip; then the number will be divisible by 2.</p>
      <p><strong>2. Which of the following number is divisible by 2?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>243, 456, 553, 772</strong></p>
      <p>456, and 772 are divisible by 2 as they end with multiples of 2.</p>
      <p><strong>3. How to explain the divisibility rule of 2 with an example?</strong></p>
      <p>As we know, the divisibility rule of 2 is the number which is having the end digit as an even number then it is divisible by 2.</p>
      <p>Let us consider 345. As 345 ends with the odd number, it is not divisible by 2.</p>
      <h3>Final Words</h3>
      <p>Hope that the information, that was given above on divisibility rule of 2 has shed some light on you. Now, you can easily identify any type of number easily whether it can be divisible by 2 or not. Share this information with your friends, so that no one feels difficulty dividing the largest numbers by 2.
