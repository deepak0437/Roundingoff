                the ten thousands place.</li>
            <li>If the ten thousands place digit is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 simply round down and keep the ten thouands place
                same and the digits next to it zero. </li>
            <li>On the other hand, If the thousands digit is 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 simply round up and increase the hundred

        <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> Round 674,352 to the Nearest Hundred Thousand? </p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
        <p>Given Number is 674352 </p>
        <p>First and foremost step is to look at the digit on the right of hundred thousand i.e. ten thousand</p>
        <p>Here the ten thousands digit is 7. As 7 >=5 we will round up and increase the hundred thousand number by
            1 and remaining digits as 0. i.e. 6+1 =7</p>
        <p>Therefore, 674352 rounded to the nearest hundred thousand is 700000</p>
        <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Round 844,252 to the Nearest Hundred Thousand? </p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
        <p>Given Number is 844252 </p>
        <p>To round to the nearest hundred thousand we need to look at the digit in the ten thousand to decide
            whether we have to round up or round down.</p>
        <p>Digit in the ten thousands place is 4 Since 4 < 5 we will round down and keep the hundreds digit same and
                rest of the digits to zero.</p>
                <p>Therefore, 844252 rounded to the nearest hundred thousands place is 840000</p>
