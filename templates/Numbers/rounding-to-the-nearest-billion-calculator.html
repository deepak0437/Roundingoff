        <p>Provided steps make you understand how to round off the given number to the nearest billion in an easy way.
          Follow the simple steps carefully:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>First and foremost, recognize which place value is billions and then the digit that you are rounding to.
          </li>
          <li>Look at the identified rounding value ie., one hundred million place value.</li>
          <li>In case, one hundred million place value is greater than or equal to 5 simply round up the billions place
            by 1 and trim the values to the right of it.</li>
          <li>If the one hundred million place value is less than 5, round down the billions place by keeping the digit
            as it is and the remaining digits after it as zero.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Rounding to the Nearest 1000000000 Examples</h3>
        <p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
        <p>What is 2098650589 rounded to nearest one billion?</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
        <p>Given number is 2,098,650,589</p>
        <p>First, identify the billion place which is 2</p>
        <p>Now, identify the one hundred million place to round the billion place. Here 0 is the one hundred million
          place value.</p>
        <p>0 is less than 5, so round down the number by keeping the billion place same and write all digits 0 after
          billion place value.</p>
        <p>Hence, 2,098,650,589 rounded value to the nearest billion is 2,000,000,000.</p>
        <p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
        <p>Round 8,925,667,890 to the Billion Place</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
        <p>Given number is 8,925,667,890</p>
        <p>8 is the billion place value and 9 is the right value to the billion (which is one hundred million).</p>
        <p>Look at the one hundred million, to round up or down the given number.</p>
        <p>Here, 9 is greater than 5 so add 1 to the billion value and rest of digits becomes zero.</p>
        <p>Hence, 8,925,667,890 round off number yo the nearest 1,000,000,000 is 9,000,000,000.</p>
