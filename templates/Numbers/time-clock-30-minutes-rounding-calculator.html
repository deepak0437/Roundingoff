            <p class="answer">Rounding a number means making it simpler by keeping its original value intact but closer
                to the next number. Rounding off numbers is done to preserve the significant figures. </p>
            <hr>
            <p class="question"><strong>2. What is round half away from zero?</strong></p>
            <p class="answer">Rounding half away from zero is a tie-breaking rounding method and it is used to round
