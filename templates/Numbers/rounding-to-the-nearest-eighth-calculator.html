      <p>  Go through the below sections to get the step by step process to round a number to the nearest multiple of 8.</p>
<ul><li>Take any number to round it to the nearest eighth.</li>
<li>Get the multiple numbers of 8 that are nearest to the given number.</li>
<li>Find the difference between those numbers and the given number.</li>
<li>Round it to the number which has lesser difference.</li></ul>
            <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Question: What is 76.52 rounded to the nearest eighth?</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Given number is 76.52</p>
<p> The nearest multiples of 8 are 64, 72 and 80</p>
<p> Find the difference between the number and multiples</p>
<p> 64 - 76.52 = -12.52</p>
<p> 72 - 76.52 = -4.52</p>
<p>80 - 76.52 = 3.48</p>
<p> So, the rounding to the nearest 8th is 80.</p>
