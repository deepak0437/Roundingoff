        <p>Replacing the approximate number to the given number to the nearest 10 is called rounding off to the nearest
          tens. We have to follow a certain set of formula rules to round off the number to the nearest 10. So, below we
          have provided rules for round off to the nearest tens.</p>
        <h3>Rules to Follow While Rounding Number to the Nearest Tens</h3>
        <p>Rule 1: If the digit is one, two, three, or four then round down the number.<br />Rue 2: If the digit is

          <li>First, take the tens place digit and look at the right place value.</li>
          <li>If the right place digit or one place digit is &gt;= 5, then add 1 to the tens place, and the remaining
            digits after tens place become 0.</li>
          <li>If the <a href="https://ccssmathanswers.com/whole-numbers/">whole number</a> place digit is &lt;5, then

        <h3>Rounding Off Numbers to the Nearest Tens Examples</h3>
        <p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
        <p>Solve 770 rounded to the nearest ten.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
        <p>Given number is 770</p>
        <p>Here, 7 is in the tens place value and 0 is in the ones place value</p>
        <p>The ones' place digit is less than 5 so round down the number for rounding off the number to the nearest 10.
        </p>
        <p>Hence, 770 is the rounded value to the nearest 10.</p>
        <p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
        <p>Round 6787 to the nearest tens.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
        <p>Given number is 6787</p>
        <p>To round the number to the nearest tens, consider the right place value to tens and check whether it is
          greater or less than 5.</p>
        <p>Here, 7 is greater than 5 so round up the number by adding 1 to the tens place and the remaining digits
          become 0.</p>
        <p>Hence, the 6787 rounded value to the nearest tens is 6790.</p>
