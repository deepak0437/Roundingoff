          This time rounding calculator, rounds the given time to its nearest time.
        </p>
        <p>
          It rounds the minute to its nearest multiple of 5 and if nearest multiple is 60, then it add 1 to hours and
          make minute value 0.
        </p>

        <p>
          Also, this calculator is made in 24-hour time format clock.i.e., From 0:00 to 11:59, it shows a.m. otherwise
          p.m.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here, given minute = {{m}} <br>
          Nearest multiple of 5 of {{m}} = {% if minu != "00" %} {{minu}} minutes. {% else %} 60 minutes. {% endif %}
        </p>
        <p>
          {% if minu != "00" %}
          {% else %}
          Here, resultant minute = 60.<br>
          So, we increment {{inp}} hr by 1, keeping in mind 24 hr time format.
          Therefore, resultant hour will be : {{hr}} hours.

    <div class="card-body">
      <p>In a nutshell Time Clock Rounding is nothing but the process of rounding up or rounding down by set increments.
        Depending on the situation you can choose from any of the time clock roundings available. Common Clock Time
        Roundings include 5-minute increments, 6-minute increments, 15-minute increments or quarter hour rounding, etc.

      <h3 class="h3">Common Clock Time Rounding Methods & Their Rules?</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p>There are several rounding methods available to round the clock time. However, we have outlined some of the
        common and most popularly used rounding techniques in the below modules. They are as under</p>
      <p><strong>15-Minute Rounding:</strong> In case of 15-Minute Time Clock Rounding or Quarter Hour Time Clock
        Rounding we will keep two thresholds for clock-ins and clock-outs whether to round up or round down. For the
        first 7.5 minutes we will round down and for the second 7.5 minutes we will round up to full quarter of an hour.
        For example: 15.8 rounded to 15 minutes is 15.15, 6.05 rounded to 15 minutes is 6.00 </p>
      <p><strong>5-Minute Rounding:</strong> Just like 15-minute rounding process, 5-minute rounding method also splits
        every 5 minutes into 2 parts of 2.5 minutes. For the first 2.5 minutes clock-in time we will round down and for
        the second 2.5 minutes we will round up to the nearest 5 minutes. For example: 8.03 rounded to 5-minutes is 8.05
        and 17.02 rounded to 5-minutes is 17.00 </p>
      <p><strong>6-Minutes Rounding or Rounding to 1/10th of an Hour:</strong> Rounding to 1/10th of an hour uses
        3-minute intervals. For the first 3-minutes we will round down the given time and for the second half of
        3-minutes is rounded up to nearest 6 minutes. For example 7:28 rounded to nearest 6 minutes is 8:00 and 9:03
        rounded to nearest 6 minutes is 9:00 </p>
    </div>

      <h3 class="h3">Clock Time Rounding Examples</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> What is 15:03 rounded to 1/10th of an hour? </p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Given Clock Time is 15:03</p>
      <p>As we want to round to it 1/10th of an hour we will see whether it falls in the first or second class of
        3-minute split interval</p>
      <p>Since it is 03 minutes we will round down</p>
      <p>Therefore, 15:03 rounded to the 1/10th of an hour is 15.</p>
      <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> An Employee punches in the office at 8:56 AM? Find the office time rounded to
        5-minutes? </p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Given Clock Time is 8:56 AM</p>
      <p>Since we want to round the clock time using 5-minute rounding we will first see whether the time falls under
        first half of the 2.5 mins interval or second half of 2.5 minutes interval </p>
      <p>8:52 AM rounded to 5-minutes is 8:50 AM</p>
      <p><strong>Example 3:</strong> Round 7:05 to 1/4th of an hour? </p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Given Clock Time = 7:05</p>
      <p>Since we want to round to 1/4th of an hour we will see whether the given clock time falls in the first half or
        second half of 7.5 minute split interval and thereby round up or round down accordingly.</p>
      <p>Since 5 minutes falls in the first 7.5 minute interval we will round down i.e. 7:05 rounded to 15 minutes is
        7:00</p>
