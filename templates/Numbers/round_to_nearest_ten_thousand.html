        <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> Round 931857 to the Nearest Ten Thousand? </p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
        <p>Given Number is 931857 </p>
        <p>As we explained in the procedure for rounding to the nearest ten thousand we will first identify the
            thousands digit i.e. 1</p>
        <p>Since 1 > 5 we will round down and keep the ten thousands place same</p>
        <p>Therefore, 931857 rounded to the nearest ten thousands place is 93000</p>
        <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Round 59678 to the Nearest Ten Thousand? </p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
        <p>Given Number is 59678 </p>
        <p>Let us observe the thousands place to make a decision on whether to round up or round down</p>
        <p>Since 9 > 5 we will round up and round up the ten thousands place and increase by 1.</p>
        <p>Therefore, 59678 rounded to the nearest ten thousands place is 60000</p>
