            <h3>Rounding to a Million Example</h3>
            <p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
            <p>Sai says that 5,562,145 rounded to the nearest million is 5,000,000. Why is he incorrect?</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
            <p>5 is in the million column, meaning five million.</p>
            <p>To round to the nearest million, take a look at the digit in the column to the right, which is the
                hundred thousands. </p>
            <p>5,<strong>5</strong>62,145</p>
            <p>The number in the hundred thousands column is 5.</p>
            <p>As per the rule, if the number is 5 or more than it, round up the number.</p>
            <p>Hence, sai need to round up to <strong>6,000,000.</strong></p>
