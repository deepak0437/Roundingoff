        The primary rule in rounding to the nearest tenths is check the hundredths digit i.e 2

            <p>Follow the below provided steps to rounding off fractions to the nearest whole number or nearest tenths, hundredths and thousandth number.</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Take any fraction.</li>
                <li> Convert the given fraction into decimal by dividing numerator by denominator.</li>
                <li> If the obtained number to the right of the decimal point is 0.5 or more, then add 1 to the left of the decimal point and remove the decimal part.</li>
                <li> If the obtained number to the right of the decimal point is lesser than 0.5, then leave the number to left of decimal point and remove the decimal part.</li>
                <li> Write the new number as rounded number.</li>
           </ul>
            <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Question : What is 15/8 is rounded to the nearest whole number?</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Given fraction is 15/8</p>
<p>  15/8 = 1.875</p>
<p>  The number right of the decimal point is .8 which is greater than .5. So, add 1 to the left of the decimal point and remove decimal part.</p>
<p>  1 + 1 = 2</p>
<p>  Therefore, the rounded 15/8 to the nearest whole number is 2.</p>
