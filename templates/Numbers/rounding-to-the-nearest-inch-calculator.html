      <p>The following is the simple procedure to round off a number to its nearest inch value easily. Check out the
        instructions, guidelines, rounding rules and follow them to get the answer effortlessly.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Take any number that is having fractional part.</li>
        <li>Check wheather the fractional part of the nummber is less than 1/2.</li>
        <li>If it is less than 1/2, then remove fractional part and remaining number becomes the nearest inch value.
        </li>
        <li>When the fractional part is equal to or more than 1/2, then add 1 to the integer part and that is the
          nearest inch value.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
      <p>Question: What is 2 (3/5)" rounded to the nearest inch?</p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
      <p>Given number is 2 (3/5)"</p>
      <p> Here the fractional part is 3/5</p>
      <p>3/5 is more than 1/2. So, add 1 to the integer part</p>
      <p> 2+1 = 3</p>
      <p> Therefore, 2 (3/5)" rounded to the nearest inch is 3.</p>
