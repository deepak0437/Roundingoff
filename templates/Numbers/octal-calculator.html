        </div>
	    <div class="card-body">
            <p>Go through the following simple steps to perform arithmetic operations on any two octal numbers. You can have a loook at the procedure of how to add, subtract, multiply and divide the octal numbers in the following sections.</p>
         <ol>
             <li><strong>Addition:</strong></li>
             <ul>
                <li>Take any two octal numbers.</li>
                <li>Octal numbers are from 0 to 7.</li>
                    <li>Write numbers one by one.</li>
                    <li>Perform addition operation between two numbers from units place to left wards.</li>
                    <li>For example, add 1+7 is equal to 10 which means 1 as carry and 0 in the answer place. </li>
                    <li>Adding of remaining numbers which gives result less than 7 remains same.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Example Question: What is 12 + 37?</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp1</p>
                &nbsp1 2</p>
                  + 3 7</p>
                  = 4 1</p>
                  12 + 37 = 41</p>
                  <li><strong>Subtraction:</strong></li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Write two numbers one by one at different lines.</li>
                    <li>If the number 1 is less than number 2, then borrow from the next number.</li>
                    <li>Subtract the numbers.</li>
                        <li>Add result at the next line.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>   Example question: Solve 321 - 46?</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
                    <p>&nbsp3 2 1</p>
                    <p>- 0 4 6</p>
                    <p>= 2 5 3 </p>
                    <p>321 - 46 = 2 5 3</p>
                    <li><strong>Multiplication:</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Take any two numbers and write them one after other.</li>
                        <li>Multiply the first digit of second number with all the digits of first number.</li>
                        <li>Continue multiplication of all digits of second numbers as the above step till none left.</li>
                            <li>Add zero at the first place of second row.</li>
                            <li>Perform the addition of obtained numbers to get the result.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>   Example question: Solve 32 x 25?</strong></p>
