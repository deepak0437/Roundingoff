<p>16.228 → 16.20</p>
<p>22.87 - As the value next to decimal place is 7 round up and change the second digit to 0 and increase one's place by 1</p>
<p>22.87 → 22.90</p>
<p>109.09 - As the value next to decimal place is 9 round up and change the second digit to 0 and increase one's place by 1</p>
<p>109.09 → 109.10</p>
